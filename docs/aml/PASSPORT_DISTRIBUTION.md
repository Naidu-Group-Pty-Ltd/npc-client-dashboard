# Distributing one Passport to several partners

**Read this before touching `passportRecipients.pure.ts`, `PassportRecipientsPanel`,
the `deliver_to` argument on `grantAccess`, or the wizard's grant step.**

A Compliance Passport exists so that one completed CDD process can be relied on
by every partner in a matter — the financier, the builder, the conveyancer —
without any of them re-approaching the client. Distributing it to several
partners is not an advanced case; it is the product. It had no surface, and the
one send path it did have was silent about the only thing that matters.

## What was reported, and what was actually true

> "I am trying to allocate the same client's Passport through to alternative
> partners that are existing and new ones, however the existing portals do not
> seem to be receiving the links, notifications or any communication through."

Every instinct here is wrong, and the register proves it. `aml.reliance_grants`
held **two** grants for the same case and organisation, both correct, both
active, both with a live token hash. Multiple distribution already persisted
perfectly. The newest grant's `delivered_to_email` was **null**.

`grant_access` emails the Passport link when — and only when — it is handed a
`deliver_to`. The onboarding wizard called it as:

```ts
const res = await amlRelianceApi.grantAccess(caseId, agreement.id);
```

No argument, no email, no error. The grant was minted, the audit event was
written, the partner-access notification fired from the table trigger, the
workspace drew a green badge — and nothing was ever sent to the partner. The
operator was handed a raw bearer token and told to "deliver it to the partner
through their usual channel", which is not a channel.

Three facts compounded it:

| Fact | Consequence |
| --- | --- |
| `aml.partner_portal_memberships` is empty | no partner is inside a portal on this deployment |
| every `aml_partner_workspace_*` flag is `false` | there is no in-portal Passport surface to appear in |
| the token is stored as a SHA-256 hash only | the link shown once was the only copy in existence |

So the operator was waiting for something to appear in a portal that has no
such screen, for a partner who was never emailed, holding a credential that
could not be recovered.

## The rules

**Delivery is part of the act, not an option on it.** The workspace's send path
requires an address and refuses to mint against anything that is not one. A
grant nobody was emailed is access with no channel, and it is indistinguishable
from a healthy grant in every register — which is exactly how this survived.
`passportRecipients` gives it a state of its own, `undelivered`, and the panel
leads with it.

**Holding a Passport and having been SENT one are different facts.** They can
disagree, and the reading carries both. Nothing counts a partner as holding a
Passport because a row exists.

**A live link can never be re-read, so sending again is a REPLACEMENT.** Only
the hash is stored. A holder's send passes `reissue_of`, which supersedes the
link they have; the workspace says so before the click rather than in a toast
afterwards. Offering to "resend the same link" would promise a copy nothing —
including this platform — can produce.

**A row is an arrangement, never a person.** `grant_access` takes an agreement
id and refuses without an active one, so the unit of distribution is the
written arrangement under Pt 2 Div 7. A partner with no arrangement is not a
row here; they are an onboarding.

## Why there is exactly one send path

There were two, and that is why one of them was wrong.

`issuePassportTo` handed the minted link to `PassportIssuedDialog`, which holds
it as a read-only field VALUE. `reissueGrant` passed it as a prompt field's
`placeholder`. Placeholder text is not a value: it cannot be selected, cannot
be copied, is not submitted, and is not in the DOM as a value. So the box a
reader saw as "the link", at the one moment the credential existed, was empty —
the defect that was reported, fixed on the first path, and survived untouched
on the second.

`sendPassport` is now the only path. A re-issue is that same act with
`reissue_of` set, which is also why it cannot become a weaker act than a first
grant: every precondition is re-run by construction.

The same reasoning added `PromptField.value`. A dialog that "pre-fills" an
address by placeholder alone makes an operator retype something the platform
already holds; the send box opens with the address the link last went to, or
the address that accepted the agreement, and null rather than a guess when
neither exists. It never borrows another organisation's address.

## The access token

The raw bearer token and the `/passport/<token>` link are the same credential.
The link is what a person opens; the token exists for a partner system reading
the Passport over the API without a browser.

Presenting the token as the deliverable asked an everyday operator to answer a
question they do not have — *what is this, and do I need it?* — at the exact
moment they were trying to finish. It is now behind a disclosure labelled for
what it is. It is still shown once, because it still cannot be read again.

## What the panel is allowed to say

`passportRecipients` derives no obligation, no readiness and no compliance
verdict. Every state is arithmetic over rows the case already holds, and every
send is re-decided by `grant_access`, which re-checks the arrangement, its
review date, the client's `compliance_sharing` consent and the attestation and
refuses in its own words.

The headline is a count. A test asserts it can never spell *clear*,
*compliant*, *verified* or *satisfied* — a distribution list is not a statement
about the customer.

And the panel says plainly where a Passport actually appears. With every
`aml_partner_workspace_*` flag off, the emailed link is the only channel a
partner has, and an operator who believes otherwise waits for a portal screen
that does not exist on this deployment.

## Tests that carry it

- `src/lib/aml/passport/passportRecipients.test.ts` — the reading: undelivered
  is not live, a holder's act supersedes, blockers are per-row, the suggested
  address is never borrowed, the headline is never a verdict.
- `src/components/aml/__tests__/passportRecipients.test.tsx` — **rendered**.
  Clicking the act reaches `grantAccess` with a `deliver_to`; a holder's click
  carries `reissue_of`; the address box opens holding a value; the one-time
  link is a real value in the DOM.
- `src/components/aml/__tests__/partnerOnboardingDelivery.test.tsx` —
  **rendered**. The wizard passes `deliver_to`. No source-scanning test could
  see its absence, because the call was present and spelled correctly.
