/**
 * Investment Compass — block helpers driven by a resolved manifest.
 *
 * ## How this differs from `scripts/template-library/blocks.ts`
 *
 * That module compiles the *voice* system: five studio voices keyed to the
 * catalogue's `style` axis, which is what the forty original seeded templates
 * are built in. This one compiles the *family* system from the approved
 * Investment Compass catalogue, where a template's look is a resolved manifest
 * of ~21 keys rather than a voice name.
 *
 * They are deliberately separate modules over one shared renderer. Merging them
 * would mean either bending the manifest keys into voice fields — losing the
 * distinctions the catalogue draws — or rewriting forty working templates to
 * prove a point. The renderer, the schema, the publish gate and the seed
 * pipeline are all shared; only the authoring vocabulary differs.
 *
 * ## The rules that hold
 *
 *  1. **Geometry is computed.** `flow()` stacks from the manifest's own margin,
 *     so a density change moves every block rather than needing 300 `y` values
 *     re-entered. Overflow past the footer is recorded and fails the build.
 *  2. **No literal colours.** Every colour is `token:*`, which is what lets a
 *     colourway repaint the document and keeps `isBrandSafe()` true.
 *  3. **Type comes from the family, not the call site.** A helper never takes a
 *     point size from its caller; it reads the family's measured scale at the
 *     template's density.
 *  4. **Every value a report supplies is a `{{binding}}`.**
 *  5. **Nothing reads a manifest string directly.** Everything goes through
 *     `resolvers.ts`, which throws on a value it has no mapping for. That is
 *     what stops a new family silently rendering as somebody else's layout.

 * Points of height a bound paragraph of `chars` characters needs.

 * ## Why a height has to be measured rather than assumed
 *
 * Every height in this file is a promise: `flow()` stacks the next block at
 * `y + height`, and the renderer positions absolutely, so a block whose text
 * sets taller than its declared height does not push the page down — it lays
 * over whatever comes next. The overflow guard cannot see that, because the
 * page's own bottom is never crossed. Two blocks can be printed on top of each
 * other and every arithmetic check passes.
 *
 * That is exactly what the Portfolio masters did on their first render: 463
 * overlapping pairs across 50 templates, because a definition list reserved one
 * line per item while the analysis writes 131-456 characters into each. The
 * lengths are not guessable from the field names — `financialHealth.lvrRisk` is
 * 3-6 characters ("Low") and `financialHealth.analysis` is 458-1620.
 *
 * So a format that binds model-authored prose passes the character count it
 * measured against production, and gets a height that fits it.
 *
 * The ratio is the average advance width of the body faces this catalogue
 * uses, as a fraction of the type size — 0.5 is the conventional figure for a
 * serif or humanist sans at text sizes, and reading it slightly wide is the
 * safe direction here.

/**
 * Keep a trailing block only on the variants that have room for it.
 *
 * The ten families are the same page size and do not have the same measure: a
 * deeper running head, a taller section opener and a looser spacing scale
 * compound, and the gap between the roomiest variant and the tightest is over
 * 150pt — two blocks' worth. So a block sized to complete one variant's page
 * runs another's past the footer, and a block sized to fit every variant leaves
 * the roomy ones half empty.
 *
 * Neither is the right trade for an *optional* block — one that adds context
 * rather than carrying the argument. This measures what is left after the
 * required items and keeps as many of the optional ones as actually fit. Pass
 * the same `startY` that `flow()` will be given, or the arithmetic is against a
 * different page.
 *
 * Optional items are trailing by construction: they are appended after the
 * required ones. A block that must appear in the middle of a page is not
 * optional, and belongs in `required`.
 *
 * `SLACK` is why the arithmetic is not "does it fit". Every declared height is
 * an estimate of how tall type will set — a KPI band whose label wraps to a
 * second line, a note that runs on — and the estimates are good to within about
 * a line. A *required* block absorbs that: it is on the page either way. An
 * optional one placed with nothing to spare turns a 20pt estimate error into a
 * block printed over the one above it, which is the failure this whole
 * mechanism exists to avoid. So an optional block has to fit comfortably, and
 * a line and a half is what "comfortably" was measured to need.

 * ## The renderer writes the list; `entries` only sizes it
 *
 * `toc` does not draw what it is handed. It walks the document's own rendered
 * pages and sets one row per page, with that page's real name and real number —
 * which is the right behaviour, because it stays true when a conditional page
 * drops out and a hand-written list does not.
 *
 * `title` is the block's *heading*, and this used to be given
 * `entries.join('\n')`. A `<div>` collapses newlines, so every contents page in
 * seven formats printed all twelve section names as one run-on line at heading
 * size — "The verdict Executive summary The ranking The scorecard Money ·
 * return, cash flow …" — set above the real list, which was directly beneath it.
 * The page already carries a `sectionHeading` reading "Contents", so the block
 * wants no heading of its own: the renderer omits it when it is empty.
 *
 * `entries` is therefore a size hint and nothing else, and it is a floor rather
 * than the truth — the row count is the document's page count, which is larger
 * than the list of section names whenever a section runs to more than one page.
 * `ROW_SLACK` covers that gap, because a block that declares less height than
 * it draws does not overflow the page, it prints over whatever is under it.

/**
 * A plate on its own page.
 *
 * ## Why a plate is a page and never a slot in the flow
 *
 * The archetype runs its narrative plate across the top of a content page with
 * the heading reversed out of it. That is the better picture and the wrong
 * shape for a fixed-position renderer with no reflow, for two reasons that
 * pull in the same direction:
 *
 *   - The pages the plates belong to are already full. Dropping 90mm of
 *     photograph into "The property" or "Investment thesis" overflowed eight of
 *     the ten plated variants — up to 123pt past the content bottom on
 *     `le-03`, which is a page and a half of prose pushed off the paper.
 *   - Most reports carry no photographs at all. An inline plate reserves its
 *     height whether or not it is filled, so the common case would be a hole in
 *     the middle of the argument, or (worse) type set over blank space where a
 *     picture was supposed to be.
 *
 * A page solves both. It always fits, because it is measured against nothing;
 * and it carries the plate's `conditional` on the PAGE, so an unfilled plate
 * costs no page rather than an empty one. `visiblePages` filters it out before
 * anything is laid out, which is why this is the only placement that vanishes
 * completely.
 *
 * ## The two treatments
 *
 * `bleed` is the family's difference, not a per-plate option. Luxury Editorial
 * is a monograph — its plates run to the trim with the asset's name reversed
 * out of a scrim at the foot, and the page ground is the field colour so an
 * unfilled edge is never white. Architectural Property measures instead of
 * bleeds: the plate is inset to the page margin and captioned "FIGURE N ·" in
 * tracked mono, which is what its `four_measured` slot plan names.
