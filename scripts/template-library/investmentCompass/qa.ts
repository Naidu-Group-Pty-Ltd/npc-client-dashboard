/**
 * Investment Compass — render QA.
 *
 * ## Why this exists on top of the spec suite
 *
 * `investmentCompassCatalogue.spec.ts` proves the templates parse, render and
 * carry their colourways. It cannot prove they FIT: `flow()`'s overflow guard
 * is arithmetic over the heights the authoring helpers declare, and a declared
 * height is a guess about how tall a paragraph of bound text will set. The only
 * honest measure of whether a block runs past the footer is to lay the document
 * out and look at the boxes.
 *
 * So this opens each rendered document in Chromium at A4, measures every
 * block's real bounding box against its page, and reports anything that
 * overflows. It also prints a PDF through the browser's own print pipeline and
 * screenshots the pages a reviewer would want to see.
 *
 * This is not a substitute for a WeasyPrint render — that engine is what
 * production uses, and it paginates differently. It is the check that catches
 * the class of defect the arithmetic cannot: text that is taller than the
 * author thought.
 *
 * Run:  npm run templates:compass:qa
 * Output: artifacts under `audit-output/investment-compass/`.

 * clipped, so a block whose text sets taller than its declaration does not push
 * the page down and does not cross the page's bottom edge — it simply prints
 * over whatever comes next. Every arithmetic check passes and two paragraphs
 * are laid on top of each other on a client's page.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. The first run of this measure found 463 overlapping
 * pairs across the 50 Portfolio masters, 24 across the Investment Compass ones
 * and 15 across Borrowing Capacity — all shipped, all invisible to the overflow
 * guard.
 *
 * Two things make the measure honest rather than noisy. It compares the **ink**
 * — the union of each block's own text-node rects — because a footer text block
 * spans the full measure while its page number sits at the right end of the
 * same band, and their boxes overlap where no reader would ever see it. And it
 * skips the **cover**, which composes deliberately overlapping layers: a
 * wordmark over a photographic plate is the design, not a fault.

 * ## The fixture was the front matter of a 34-page report
 *
 * `SAMPLE_REPORT_DATA` carries no narrative and no `report.type`, and both are
 * load-bearing here. The masters gate every body page on
 * `narrative && narrative.pages > n`, and `planNarrative` — the pre-pass that
 * computes the true page count from the template's own geometry — returns null
 * for a report type it does not recognise. So with the fixture as shipped, the
 * Investment Compass masters rendered **7 of 50 pages**: Cover, Contents,
 * Executive dashboard, The assessment, Risk and recommendation, Sources and
 * methodology, Important information.
 *
 * Measured 20 Sep 2026 on the first three masters, with a body at the
 * registry's declared size and `report.type` set as the adapter sets it:
 * Chancery 7 -> 25, Chancery Compact 7 -> 21, Sovereign Folio 8 -> 32. Every
 * body page, the overflow notice and both financial-modelling pages had never
 * been laid out by this gate on any run.
 *
 * That is `WHAT_THE_PAGE_ACTUALLY_DRAWS.md` §5 one level up: a fixture shorter
 * than the product turns a real measurement into a statement about the
 * fixture. `SAMPLE_REPORT_DATA` itself is left alone — it is the BINDING
 * fixture the catalogue specs assert rendered output against, and its job is
 * to resolve every bound path. The geometric measure needs a document-sized
 * body, and composes one here.
 *
 * ## And four of the five documents had never been drawn
 *
 * The Investment masters serve five document kinds through one page sequence
 * (`tierPageSequence.pure.ts`), and the fixture's tier is `compass` — so the
 * Snapshot, Executive Briefing, Financial Analysis and Due Diligence reports
 * were outside the measurement entirely, as were the two pages only a tier
 * that draws financial modelling prints. The tier is set where the production
 * adapter sets it: top level, which is what `pagesForDocument` reads, AND on
 * `report`, which is what the projection publishes and the masters bind.
