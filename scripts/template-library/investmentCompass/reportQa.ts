/**
 * Report Q&A on the Investment Compass families.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists, given a spec used to forbid it
 *
 * `reportQaNotOnTheFamilies.spec.ts` held that this format could not be drawn
 * by a fixed-layout master, and it was right about the vocabulary as it stood:
 * no block rendered Markdown, and 70% of the 565 stored answers carry inline
 * bold, 48% a heading, 56% a list and 19% a pipe table. Bound to a `text-block`
 * every one of those printed as its own source on a client's page.
 *
 * `markdown-block` closed that. It takes Markdown **source** and renders it
 * through the programme's escape-first renderer, so it cannot emit markup the
 * model chose — which is what let it into `PRODUCTION_SAFE_BLOCK_TYPES` without
 * putting a hole in a security allow-list.
 *
 * ## What these masters draw, and what they leave to the flowing route
 *
 * One exchange, in depth. That is the document a fixed page sequence suits: a
 * question, its answer set properly, the sources it was grounded in, and a list
 * of what else was asked in the same conversation.
 *
 * A whole transcript is not that document. Answers run 2,193 characters at the
 * median and 33,377 at the longest, and a conversation reaches 70 turns — no
 * fixed sequence covers that range, and `render-report-qa-pdf` paginates it
 * properly. The adapter's `legacyFallback` says so rather than implying the
 * template is a replacement.
 *
 * ## How a page sequence carries a body of unknown length
 *
 * The answer gets one page plus seven conditional continuations, each holding
 * `pageIndex` N of the same source and each conditional on
 * `qa.answerPages > N`. A conditional page that does not render costs nothing —
 * `visiblePages` filters before layout — so a median answer produces a five-page
 * document and the longest produces twelve, from one set of masters. This is the
 * Client Details Form pattern, where 742 of 775 clients get five pages and the
 * other 33 get up to thirteen.
 *
 * The page count comes from the projection, which computes it with the same
 * `packMarkdownPages` the block uses. See `reports/markdownPaging.pure.ts` for
 * why that is one function rather than two.
