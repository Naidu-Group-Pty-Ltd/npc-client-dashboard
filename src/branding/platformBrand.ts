/**
 * The platform's own mark — what a clone shows when its brand settings are empty.
 *
 * Named in ONE place because three surfaces reach for it (the tab icon, the
 * apple-touch tile, and the desktop notification shade) and a literal at each
 * end is how three ends drift. `index.html` declares the same path for the
 * pre-hydration paint; `platformBrand.spec.ts` asserts the two agree, because
 * a mismatch means the tab flickers from one mark to another on every load.
 *
 * ## Why this exists as a module rather than a default argument
 *
 * `BrandProvider` used to write the tenant's favicon and then `return` early
 * when there was none:
 *
 *     const favicon = getBrandAssetSrc(settings, 'favicon');
 *     if (!favicon) return;
 *
 * That is correct on a first load — the static `<link>` in `index.html` is
 * already the platform mark — and wrong the moment a tenant CLEARS their
 * favicon: the href written by the previous render stays on the element, so
 * the tab keeps showing a mark the workspace no longer has, until a full
 * reload. Reverting needs something to revert TO, which is this.
