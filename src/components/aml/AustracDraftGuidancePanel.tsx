/**
 * What obliges this report — beside the form, while it is being written.
 *
 * The draft dialog asked for a kind and a narrative and explained neither.
 * An operator drafting their first Suspicious Matter Report had to know,
 * from somewhere else entirely, what the trigger is, that it also covers an
 * attempted service, that the customer must not be told, and that a large
 * cash payment with nothing odd about it is a different report altogether.
 * None of that is obscure — it is simply not on the screen where the
 * decision is made.
 *
 * It renders `KIND_GUIDANCE` and `deriveAustracPath` and decides nothing of
 * its own: no field is written from here, no kind is chosen, no save is
 * blocked. The operator forms the suspicion and the MLRO approves the
 * report; a panel that quietly picked for them would be this product taking
 * a view it has no basis to take.
