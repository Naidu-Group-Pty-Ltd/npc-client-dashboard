/**
 * What the office-holder index holds, said on the step itself.
 *
 * ── Why this is not inside the dialog ─────────────────────────────────
 * It was. The coverage was reachable only as a side-effect of running a
 * search, which means an operator learned whether the index was loaded
 * AFTER they had already leaned on it — and the reading that matters most
 * is the one they get before.
 *
 * It also made a whole working integration invisible: the index loaded,
 * the endpoint answered, and Stage 5 looked exactly as it had the day
 * before, because every sign of it was two clicks deep.
 *
 * ── What it may and may not say ───────────────────────────────────────
 * The same rule as everywhere else here: this describes a TOOL, never a
 * subject. It reports how many people and offices are loaded and how
 * current they are. It says nothing about the party being determined, and
 * an index in perfect health is not evidence about anybody.
 *
 * An index that has not loaded says so plainly and does not hide the step:
 * the determination is made from the sources an operator checks, and this
 * only saves them typing.
