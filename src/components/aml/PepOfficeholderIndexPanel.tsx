/**
 * The office-holder index, inside the determination.
 *
 * ── What this renders, and the one thing it must never render ─────────
 * A HIT is a candidate. A MISS is nothing.
 *
 * Every reading this panel can show carries the index's own COVERAGE
 * underneath it — what the sources hold, what they do not, how many entries
 * loaded and when. That is not a courtesy: the dangerous reading is the empty
 * one, and an empty result with nothing beside it is indistinguishable from
 * "this person is not an office holder". This platform has already shipped
 * that shape once, with a sanctions table that was empty from the day it was
 * built.
 *
 * So there is no "no match" badge, no tick, and no green anywhere in the
 * empty state. An index that has never loaded — or whose last load failed —
 * says it is UNAVAILABLE rather than empty, because it has not looked.
 *
 * ── A candidate becomes a source only through the operator ────────────
 * "Record this" prefills the source row with the office and the identity the
 * index holds, and leaves `result` EMPTY. The operator confirms the candidate
 * against the official register and writes what they saw. The platform
 * writing that sentence for them is what would make the record indefensible.
