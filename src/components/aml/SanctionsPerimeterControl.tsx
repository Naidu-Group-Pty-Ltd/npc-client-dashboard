/**
 * Whether this case is inside the sanctions perimeter — shown to everyone,
 * changeable by a reviewer or MLRO.
 *
 * ── Why this control has to exist ─────────────────────────────────────
 * The per-scope policy shipped with no way to reach it. `sanctions` could be
 * `not_required`, but only if an `aml.case_screening_perimeter` row said so,
 * and nothing in the product wrote one. So every case stayed inside the
 * perimeter by default — correct, and completely unusable: Stage 5 went on
 * reporting "Screening cannot run yet", an inactive provider and a missing
 * DFAT list on cases that may never have needed sanctions screening, and the
 * only action offered led to a 404.
 *
 * ── What it is careful never to say ───────────────────────────────────
 * A perimeter finding is a statement about OBLIGATION: whether a designated
 * service is being provided at all. It is never a screening result. Nobody is
 * screened by recording one and nobody is cleared, and the wording here says
 * so on the page rather than leaving an operator to infer it from a green
 * badge.
 *
 * It also never stands PEP down as a side effect of standing sanctions down.
 * The scopes are excluded individually, because they answer to different
 * obligations and one finding is not a finding about all of them.
