/**
 * Stage 5's one card: what happens next, and why.
 *
 * ── What it replaces ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three panels that each said a different kind of nothing. "No screening
 * subjects recorded." "Screening has not been run." "No screening checks yet
 * for this case", over a **Run screening** button that had nobody to run
 * against. Beside them, a panel telling the operator to go resolve declared
 * parties — on a case that declared none. The reasonable conclusion from
 * that screen was "this client must not need screening", and it was wrong:
 * nobody had ever been enrolled.
 *
 * So this card leads with exactly ONE action, chosen server-side by what
 * actually blocks the stage, with the button that performs it. Everything
 * else — scope, parties, determinations — is evidence underneath it.
 *
 * ── What it will not do ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It never says PEP or sanctions are waived, exempt or not required: those
 * are mandatory determinations that get established. It never renders
 * "clear" or "no match" — it states no outcome it was not given. And
 * completing the stage is not a service-gate approval, which it says on the
 * page rather than leaving to be assumed.
 *
 * ── The resolution centre ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It now arranges the stage in four layers, because one action was necessary
 * and not sufficient: an operator also has to see WHICH determinations are
 * owed and where each has got to.
 *
 *   A  the lifecycle, one status, one action (and the other lawful route)
 *   B  required determinations, one row each
 *   C  checks that are not required, collapsed
 *   D  parties, and the evidence panels below this card
 *
 * Each row states OBLIGATION, METHOD and OUTCOME separately
 * (`screeningResolution.pure.ts`), because collapsing them into one badge is
 * exactly how "not required" came to read as "clear" and how an unavailable
 * provider came to read as a case that needed nothing.
 *
 * ── A closed case is not a stage in progress ──────────────────────────
 * When the canonical lifecycle says closed, this leads with that and offers a
 * reopen. Showing "Run screening" on a retained record asserts the journey is
 * moving when it is not.
