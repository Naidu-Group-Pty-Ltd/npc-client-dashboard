 * Stage 9, as the operator reads it.
 *
 * "To me there doesn't seem to be a clear distinction for section 9 to be
 * ticked off as green after the user has already ticked off the Approved
 * function." — and that was right twice over.
 *
 * The stage DID complete the moment the gate was approved on a case in this
 * position. Nothing on the screen said so before the click; instead a
 * four-step list sat under two progress readings that counted something
 * else ("0 of 3 items on this stage complete"), and step 4 told the operator
 * to issue a new version that could not have changed anything.
