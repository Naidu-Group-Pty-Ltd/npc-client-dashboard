/**
 * A golden capture of the Borrowing Capacity Snapshot as it ships today.
 *
 * ## Why this exists before any change is made
 *
 * `docs/reports/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` records that shipping PDF paths have **zero**
 * fidelity coverage. This is the first. It is deliberately written against the
 * *current* jsPDF generator, unmodified, so that when the report is rebuilt on
 * the design system there is something truthful to diff the result against.
 *
 * A golden is only worth having if it exercises the branches. The fixture below
 * turns on every conditional the generator has — LMI, additional assumptions,
 * recommendations, warnings, the calculation explanation, the audit trail and
 * the scenario comparison — because those are four extra pages that a
 * happy-path fixture would never reach, and four pages a migration could
 * silently drop.
 *
 * The artefact is written to `reports/` (gitignored) for rasterising and
 * eyeballing; the assertions below are what runs in CI.
