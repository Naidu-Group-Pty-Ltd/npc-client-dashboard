/**
 * The one control that hands someone a typeset Cash Flow Comparison Analysis.
 *
 * Pressing it sends the projections on screen to the server and saves the
 * document that comes back. It sits beside the two Export PDF buttons that
 * already exist rather than replacing either, and it is the only one of the
 * three that puts the ten years of every property in the comparison into a
 * client's hands.
 *
 * ## It is not gated on the written analysis, deliberately
 *
 * `exportAiAnalysisPDF` returns without drawing anything when `aiAnalysis` is
 * null, so today an adviser who has not pressed "Generate AI Analysis" has no
 * way to hand over the comparison at all. Here the analysis is a suffix: the
 * tables are the document, and a comparison without model prose is a complete
 * report that says so on its last section.
 *
 * ## What the caller passes
 *
 * A `WireComparison` built by `toWireComparison`, or null when there is not yet
 * a comparison to send — fewer than two properties, or projections that have not
 * finished computing. Null disables the button and says why, rather than hiding
 * it: a missing control reads as a feature that does not exist.
