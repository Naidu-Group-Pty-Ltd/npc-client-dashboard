/**
 * Four regressions this suite exists to stop, all of them things a screenshot
 * shows and a unit test does not.
 *
 * Asserted on source because each is a structural property of one file — that a
 * primary action is on the card rather than behind a menu, that a list comes
 * from a server round trip rather than from a table read, that a dialog has a
 * scroll boundary, and that no production menu names a finance partner. A
 * behavioural test of any one of them would pass while the property it protects
 * was reintroduced two components away.
