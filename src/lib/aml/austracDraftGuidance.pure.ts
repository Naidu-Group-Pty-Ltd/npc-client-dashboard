/**
 * Why this report is being made — the part the draft dialog never said.
 *
 * ── The defect ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The draft dialog asked an operator to choose between five report kinds
 * and then type a narrative, and said nothing at all about which one the
 * situation in front of them actually obliges. That is the decision the
 * whole lodgement rests on: an SMR and a TTR are not degrees of the same
 * thing, they are different obligations with different triggers, different
 * clocks and — for one of them only — a criminal offence attached to
 * telling the customer about it. Picking the wrong one is the easiest
 * mistake on this screen to make and the hardest to see afterwards.
 *
 * So this module carries, for each kind, four things an operator needs
 * BEFORE they type: what the report is for, when AUSTRAC must be informed,
 * what it is NOT for (with the kind that would be right instead), and what
 * the narrative has to answer. It is reference material, held in one place,
 * rendered rather than restated — the same treatment `AUSTRAC_OBLIGATIONS`
 * gives the statutory clock.
 *
 * ── Two rules ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * **It advises and never decides.** Nothing here writes a field, blocks a
 * save or picks a kind. The operator forms the suspicion and the MLRO
 * approves the report; a guidance module that quietly chose for them would
 * be this product forming a view it has no basis to form.
 *
 * **The wire kind is not the obligation kind.** `reports.kind` accepts five
 * values — `compliance` and `annual` are both the s.47 annual report — and
 * `AUSTRAC_OBLIGATIONS` is keyed by the four obligations. Reading the table
 * with a raw column value returns `undefined` and throws on the next
 * property access, which is exactly what the dialog did. `toObligationKind`
 * is the one translation, and it returns null rather than guessing.
