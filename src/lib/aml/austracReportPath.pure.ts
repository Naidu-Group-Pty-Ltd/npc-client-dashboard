/**
 * Lodging a report with AUSTRAC — the order it is actually done in.
 *
 * ── What was missing, and what was not ────────────────────────────────
 * Almost none of this is new machinery. `aml-reporting` already refuses a
 * submission that is not MLRO-approved, already demands step-up MFA, already
 * requires lodgement evidence — and for an SMR, the AUSTRAC reference
 * specifically — and already requires an explicit no-tipping-off
 * attestation before it will write a submission. The server was rigorous.
 *
 * The surface in front of it was a dialog with five boxes: Kind, Reference
 * code, Title, Narrative, Period. Nothing said what happens next, nothing
 * said when the report is due, and — the defect that matters most — nothing
 * asked WHICH CUSTOMER it was about. `reports.case_id` has existed from the
 * first migration and the dialog never set it, so every report ever drafted
 * was filed against nobody. A report about a customer that is not on that
 * customer's file is not on file.
 *
 * ── The path ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Six steps, one of them open, in the order they are answered. This is the
 * same shape Stage 5 and Stage 9 use, deliberately: an operator who has
 * learned one guided path in this product has learned all of them.
 *
 * ── The one rule that shapes everything ───────────────────────────────
 * **The platform never lodges.** AUSTRAC Online is the reporting entity's
 * own account, reached with its own credentials, by the person authorised to
 * use it. What this product does is assemble the report, hold the evidence
 * behind it, record who approved it, and keep the receipt — and it says so
 * on the step, so nobody waits for a submission that was always theirs to
 * make.
