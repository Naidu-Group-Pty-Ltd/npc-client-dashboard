/**
 * Stage 9 — the road from the recorded decision to an issued Passport, in
 * order, with the previous stage's outcome PULLED THROUGH.
 *
 * ── The defects this replaces ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Stage 9 was three disconnected panels. Nothing on it said the case had
 * been CLEARED at Stage 8 — the reader saw "Under review — not yet
 * decided" about the gate and read it as the decision not pulling
 * through. Nothing ordered gate → preview → issue, so how the Aurixa
 * Passport actually gets issued was a hunt. And the stage's primary
 * button carried no actionType, so it fell to the workspace switch's
 * default — a scroll to a screening anchor that does not exist here —
 * the same broken-button class as Stages 6, 7 and 8 before it.
 *
 * ── What this module is ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Arrangement only. The decision comes from the case row, the gate from
 * the gate column, the credential state from the SERVER-derived passport
 * projection (this module never derives a passport state of its own —
 * that is the one rule the passport facts carry). Issuance stays where it
 * belongs: the MLRO controls in the reliance panel; preview is the
 * digital passport page, exactly as the client and partners will see it.

   *
   *     ── The trap this branch exists to close ──────────────────────
   *     `refresh_required` is ONE code covering two different owed acts.
   *     On the reported case the attestation was v1, issued, unsuperseded,
   *     with zero open refresh obligations — and the state read "Refresh
   *     required" for exactly one reason: `service_gate_regressed`,
   *     because the gate was still `under_review`.
   *
   *     This step then said "a newer version is needed", the reliance
   *     panel offered "Reissue as v2" as the open act, and following that
   *     advice supersedes a good v1 for nothing — because v2 reads
   *     `refresh_required` too while the gate is unapproved. A remedy that
   *     cannot discharge the reason is a loop with an audit trail.
   *
   *     `refreshRemedy` is the one place that knows which act clears which
   *     reason. Where the gate is the ONLY reason, the issuance debt is
   *     DISCHARGED — a version exists — and this step says so. Leaving it
   *     outstanding would count one fact twice (the gate step already
   *     carries it) and is why "one step left" could never fire, which is
   *     precisely the missing distinction that was reported. The stage still
   *     does not complete: the gate step is still owed, and completion is

 * off as green after the user has already ticked off the Approved
 * function." Approving the gate on a cleared case with an issued
 * attestation completes this stage outright — but nothing on the screen
