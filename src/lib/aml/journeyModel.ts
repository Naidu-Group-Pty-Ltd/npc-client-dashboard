/**
 * The AML/CTF compliance journey — ONE derived reading of where a case is.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING IN THIS FILE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This module answers a question the workspace could not answer before:
 * *whose move is it, and what is stopping this case?* It answers it the
 * same way `workspaceViewModel.ts` answers its questions — by reading
 * canonical state that already exists — and under the same four rules:
 *
 *   • It never fetches. Callers pass facts in; every function is pure.
 *   • It never persists. There is no `current_stage` column and there must
 *     not be one. A stored stage is a second truth, and a second truth is
 *     how "the journey says verified, the passport says pending" happens.
 *   • It never decides. Navigating to a stage, or reading a stage as
 *     complete, moves nothing: the service gate is still moved only by
 *     `aml-risk set_service_gate`, the Passport is still issued only by
 *     `aml-reliance issue_attestation`, and a partner still receives the
 *     credential only through server-derived distribution readiness.
 *   • It never invents. A fact that was not supplied — not loaded, not
 *     permitted, or a read that failed — produces `unknown` and is named
 *     in `unavailableFacts`. "Could not read" is never "complete".
 *
 * ── Why a tenth stage rather than a sixth phase ────────────────────────
 * `deriveAmlMacroPhase` already maps the fourteen canonical rail steps onto
 * five phases, and it stays exactly as it is: it is the coarse "where in
 * the lifecycle" reading the register and the header use. This module is
 * the *operational* reading — the ten places work actually happens, each
 * with its own owner, blockers and readiness. The two never disagree
 * because both derive from `case_stage` and the same evidence; neither
 * stores anything.
 *
 * ── Vocabulary: reused, not duplicated ─────────────────────────────────
 * `status` is `AmlEvidenceState`, the vocabulary the compliance summary
 * already uses (and which `EVIDENCE_STATE_LABELS` / `EVIDENCE_ICON` /
 * `EVIDENCE_TEXT` already present). A stage that is stopping the case adds
 * `blocking: true` and `attention: "critical"` rather than a parallel
 * `blocked` status that would have to be kept in step with the other five.
 *
 * What is genuinely new is `owner` — whose move it is. Nothing in the
 * repository expressed that, and it is the single most useful thing an
 * operator can be told about a case.

 * Order is the orchestration, not a label.
 *
 * `stageNumber()` is `indexOf + 1`, the rail renders in this order, and the
 * current stage is the first one that is blocking — so this array decides
 * what an operator is told to do next, not merely what the steps are called.
 *
 * Identity precedes Documents. Verifying who somebody is comes before
 * collecting evidence about them: the identity result determines WHICH
 * documents are required (a failed or partial verification changes the
 * requirement set), and collecting documents for an unverified subject
 * risks gathering evidence about the wrong person. The previous order put
 * Documents third and left cases sitting on "No requirements set" while
 * identity had already passed — which is what made the workspace point at
 * the wrong next action.
