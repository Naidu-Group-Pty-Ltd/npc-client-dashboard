/**
 * One partner, one row, one next step.
 *
 * ── The problem this is for ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The Compliance Passport card listed the same three partners **four
 * times**, in four vocabularies, under four headings:
 *
 *   Who holds this Passport   — the grant
 *   Written arrangements      — the agreement, as `active`,
 *                               `eligibility not recorded`, `no assessment`
 *   Compliance agreement      — the emailed acceptance
 *   Partner links             — the case link, as `builder_developer`,
 *                               `reliance`, `active`, `classification
 *                               incomplete`
 *
 * Every one of those is a fact about the same organisation, and none of them
 * said what to DO. An operator looking at eleven amber badges across two
 * lists cannot tell which one is stopping them, which is a note for later,
 * and which is simply how the record looks when everything is fine.
 *
 * ── What this is ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Presentation arithmetic that joins those four records into one row per
 * organisation and derives ONE next step. It performs nothing and authorises
 * nothing: every act it names is an existing operation that re-checks its own
 * preconditions server-side and refuses on its own terms.
 *
 * Four rules carry it.
 *
 * **One row per ORGANISATION, keyed by the arrangement.** A partner may hold
 * several case links (a builder that is also on the sale as a developer), and
 * they are one partner. The arrangement is the unit that makes disclosure
 * lawful, so it is the key, and links attach to it.
 *
 * **One next step, chosen by what actually blocks.** The steps are ordered by
 * consequence — no arrangement, then no acceptance, then nothing sent, then
 * sent-but-never-emailed, then lapsed — and the FIRST unmet one is the step.
 * Everything else is detail, and detail is not a step.
 *
 * **A badge must mean something is wrong.** `active`, `reliance` and
 * `builder_developer` are how a healthy record looks: rendering them as
 * warning-coloured chips beside genuine problems is what made eleven badges
 * unreadable. Only unmet conditions surface, and each one says what it stops.
 *
 * **Nothing here is a compliance verdict.** "Eligibility not recorded" is a
 * missing record, not a finding; "no assessment" is work outstanding, not a
 * refusal. The wording states the gap and the consequence, never a judgement
 * about the partner.
