/**
 * The Compliance Passport's acts, explained — what each button DOES, in
 * which order, and why one is unavailable right now.
 *
 * ── The defect this replaces ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The reliance panel's header was four bare buttons: "Arrangement",
 * "Issue attestation", "Material change", "Grant access". Nothing said
 * what any of them did, nothing said their order, and production held
 * ZERO written arrangements — so "Grant access" answered every click
 * with a refusal toast ("No active CDD arrangement") that read as the
 * button being broken. A blocked act must name its enabler BEFORE the
 * click, the same rule the service gate and the decision already follow.
 *
 * ── What this module is ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Presentation arithmetic only. It performs nothing, fetches nothing and
 * decides nothing — the server's `aml-reliance` ops still enforce every
 * rule (MLRO role, active arrangement, attestation existence). The
 * vocabulary here deliberately shares nothing with a clearance: an act
 * being "ready" is availability, never a compliance claim.
