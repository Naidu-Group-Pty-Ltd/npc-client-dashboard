/**
 * Stage 5 as a SEQUENCE: numbered steps, one of them current.
 *
 * ── What this replaces ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Stage 5 rendered every true thing it knew, all at once, in seven panels
 * that each had equal weight: a next-action card, a classification prompt,
 * a screening scope, a required-determinations list, a not-required
 * collapse, a perimeter statement, a people-to-assess list, a party
 * screening panel, a checks panel and an ownership panel. The single act
 * the case was actually waiting for — one PEP determination — appeared FOUR
 * times, in four different words, with four buttons, and the operator still
 * had to read the whole page to work out that everything else was already
 * settled.
 *
 * Nothing there was wrong. What was missing was ORDER. This module supplies
 * it: the same server-decided facts, arranged as the steps of one path, so
 * an operator reads down until they hit the step that is theirs.
 *
 * ── The rules that keep it honest ─────────────────────────────────────
 * 1  It DERIVES NOTHING NEW. Every obligation, method and outcome comes from
 *    `buildDeterminationRows`, which reads the server's own per-scope
 *    decision. A browser that reached its own conclusion would be a second
 *    compliance engine, and the two would drift on the day it mattered.
 *
 * 2  `not_required` IS NOT `complete`. A step nobody owes is settled — it
 *    stops holding the path open — but it is never ticked, never counted as
 *    work done, and never described as a result. This is the same rule the
 *    determination rows carry, and the reason Stage 5 exists in this shape.
 *
 * 3  THE SERVER OWNS "WHAT NEXT". When `next_action` maps onto a step, that
 *    step is the current one, whatever the local arithmetic would have said.
 *    The spine can be wrong about ordering; it must never disagree with the
 *    server about what is being asked for.
 *
 * 4  A CLOSED CASE HAS NO CURRENT STEP. It is a retained record, not a path
 *    in progress, and presenting a numbered next step on one asserts a
 *    journey that is not moving.
