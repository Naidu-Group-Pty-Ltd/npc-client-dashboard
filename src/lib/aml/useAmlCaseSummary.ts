/**
 * One batched read of the evidence the case Overview summarises.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The old Overview mounted five self-fetching cards. Rendering it cost
 * thirteen requests: the case, its client requests, three reliance reads
 * for the journey map, a consent read, and seven more from the passport
 * section — each fired from its own `useEffect`, several of them for data
 * the operator had not asked to see.
 *
 * This hook replaces that with a single parallel wave, fired once per
 * case and shared by every Overview component. The passport section and
 * the full journey map moved to Records, so they now load only when
 * somebody opens Records.
 *
 * ── Rules ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  • Every call is an EXISTING read operation. No new server operation,
 *    no direct table access, no widened projection.
 *  • Every call is individually failure-tolerant. A read that fails (or
 *    that this role may not make) resolves to `null`, and `null` reads as
 *    "not available" all the way through to the screen — never as a
 *    reassuring default.
 *  • Nothing here decides anything. It fetches facts; the pure helpers in
 *    `workspaceViewModel.ts` read them.
