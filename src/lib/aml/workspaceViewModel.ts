/**
 * AML case workspace view model — PRESENTATION ONLY.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING IN THIS FILE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything here is a *reading* of state that already exists. Nothing in
 * this module is, or may become, an authority for an AML decision:
 *
 *   • It never fetches. Callers pass facts in; the functions are pure.
 *   • It never persists. There is no `next_action` column and there must
 *     not be one — the value is recomputed from canonical state each render.
 *   • It never decides. The service gate is moved by an explicit human
 *     decision recorded server-side (`aml-risk set_service_gate`), and by
 *     nothing else. `deriveAmlServiceReadiness` reads
 *     `service_gate_status` — it does not compute a gate from risk, from
 *     identity, from screening or from how much of the UI is ticked.
 *   • It never invents. Where a fact was not supplied (not loaded, or the
 *     read failed) the derivation says `unknown` and names the missing
 *     fact rather than guessing a friendlier answer.
 *
 * The one job of this module is to let an analyst answer, in seconds:
 * what is this case, where is it, what needs attention, what is blocking
 * it, what is the risk position, what should I do next, what evidence
 * supports that, what happened recently, who else is connected, and may
 * the designated service proceed.
 *
 * Canonical inputs are the workflow dimensions in `caseDimensions.ts`
 * (`case_stage`, `client_portal_status`, `finance_portal_status`,
 * `service_gate_status`), `aml.cases.risk_rating`, and the evidence
 * projections the existing read APIs already return. The *granular*
 * fourteen-step process rail in `caseDimensions.ts` is untouched and still
 * canonical; the five macro phases below are a map drawn over it.

 * sent the MLRO straight to Stage 7 while Stages 3, 5 and 6 still had

 * action with a button, and the button skipped five stages.
 *
 * Ordering by journey position instead means the operator is always sent to
 * the EARLIEST unaddressed stage, which is the order the journey is meant to
 * be walked in and the order an auditor reads it back in.
 *
 * This map is duplicated from `JOURNEY_STAGES` rather than imported, because
 * `journeyModel` imports this module and the cycle would be worse than the
 * duplication. A spec asserts the two agree, so a stage reorder cannot
 * silently desynchronise them — that exact drift has bitten here before.
