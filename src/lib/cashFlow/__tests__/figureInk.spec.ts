/**
 * The colour a cash-flow figure takes from its sign.
 *
 * The reported defect: every negative figure in the 10-Year Projection
 * Overview rendered WHITE. The five sign-driven rows spelled the loss colour
 * `text-destructive-foreground`, which is the ink for text on a solid
 * `bg-destructive` fill — `0 0% 100%` in the light token block and in the
 * dark one, measured in Chromium as rgb(255,255,255) in both. Meanwhile the
 * two documents this screen exports had never lost it: the PDF writes
 * negatives in #B91C1C and the HTML export in #dc2626, on exactly those rows.
 *
 * These assertions are about the rule, not about a string a refactor may move.
