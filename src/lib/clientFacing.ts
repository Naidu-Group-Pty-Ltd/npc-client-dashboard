/**
 * Client-facing deployment mode.
 *
 * One build of this dashboard serves two audiences: the internal operations
 * console (everything on), and client-facing deployments where the
 * developer/operator tooling — integration credential management, the workflow
 * playground, engine diagnostics, test-data controls — must not appear at all.
 *
 * The mode is decided per BUILD by `VITE_CLIENT_FACING` and nothing else, and
 * it reaches the running code as the `__CLIENT_FACING__` constant that
 * `vite.config.ts` folds in — never by reading the environment at runtime.
 * `isClientFacingDeployment()` records what that cost.
 * Unlike `editorV2Flag` / `templateLibrary` there is deliberately no URL-param
 * or localStorage override: those exist so an operator can flip a feature for
 * one visit, and the whole point of a client-facing deployment is that a
 * visitor cannot flip the operator tooling back on from the address bar.
 * Default OFF — a build that never heard of the flag behaves exactly as today.
 *
 * This flag controls VISIBILITY, never data access. Module permissions,
 * workspace entitlements and the edge functions' own auth checks enforce
 * access independently of it; hiding a surface here changes no server
 * behaviour. In particular, hiding the Integrations page does not touch the
 * Make.com → Airtable "Property Intake Master" pipeline — that runs entirely
 * server-side and never depended on this UI being visible.
 *
 * Both the navigation filter (src/hooks/useNavigation.ts) and the route gate
 * (src/components/auth/ClientFacingGate.tsx) read the ONE list below, so what
 * is unlinked and what is unroutable cannot drift apart.
 */

/**
 * The truth table for the raw value: only an explicit opt-in enables the mode.
 *
 * Exported because `vite.config.ts` computes `__CLIENT_FACING__` with it, so
 * "what counts as on" is spelled once rather than repeated in the config.

/**
 * The mode, read from the ONE authority: the build constant.
 *
 * This used to read
 * `(import.meta as { env?: … })?.env?.VITE_CLIENT_FACING`, and that is a
 * defect with no symptom of its own until it has a very large one. The cast
 * sends the expression through esbuild's TypeScript transform, which lowers
 * the optional chain into temporaries — `(_a = import.meta) == null ? void 0 :
 * _a.env` — so the token `import.meta.env` no longer exists by the time Vite
 * substitutes it. `import.meta` therefore survives into the browser, where it
 * carries `url` and `resolve` and no `env` at all, and the whole expression is
 * `undefined`. Every client-facing build reported itself as the internal
 * console: the navigation filter never engaged, `ClientFacingGate` waved every
 * hidden URL through, and each component-level gate in
 * `docs/CLIENT_FACING_MODE.md` drew its operator control. Written plainly as
 * `import.meta.env.VITE_CLIENT_FACING` it would have folded — the bug was the
 * cast, not the idea.
 *
 * Meanwhile `__CLIENT_FACING__` is a `define`, which IS folded, and it had
 * correctly dropped five page chunks from the same bundle. So the two halves
 * of one decision disagreed inside one build, and the page behind a dropped
 * chunk rendered nothing at all.
 *
 * Nothing in this module may name `import.meta` again; a test asserts that
 * over this file's own source, because the failure is invisible in every
 * environment that has an `import.meta.env` — which includes the dev server
 * and the test runner.
