/**
 * The font contract between the type stacks and the render container.
 *
 * ## Why this test exists
 *
 * `typography.pure.ts` used to declare Cormorant Garamond, Fraunces and
 * Playfair Display as installed, on the strength of the Dockerfile's
 * `apt-get install fonts-cormorant-garamond fonts-fraunces
 * fonts-playfair-display`. **None of those three packages exists in Debian** —
 * not bookworm, not trixie. `apt-get install -y` exits non-zero on an unknown
 * package, so that layer failed and the image could not be built at all.
 *
 * Nothing said so, because nothing read the Dockerfile. This does.
 *
 * A font failure is uniquely invisible: the engine substitutes silently, the
 * PDF renders, the tests pass, and the defect is only visible to whoever opens
 * the document — which is the client.
