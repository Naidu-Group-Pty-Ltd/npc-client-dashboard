/**
 * The Borrowing Capacity projection.

 * `component`/`grossAmount`/`shadedAmount`/`shadingRate` on an income line,
 * `type`/`balance`/`limit`/`monthlyServicing` on a liability, whole-number
 * percent rates, `green`/`amber`/`red` bands. Only the values are invented.
 *
 * `docs/reports/BORROWING_CAPACITY.md` records why that matters: four drafts of
 * that format's fixture invented shapes and "every one produced a page of
 * plausible-looking wrong output". A fixture written from imagination passes
