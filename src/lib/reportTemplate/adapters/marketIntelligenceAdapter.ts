/**
 * Market Intelligence, through the normaliser its own render route uses.
 *
 * `buildMarketIntelligenceReport` applies three editorial strips before a word
 * reaches a page — the model's "data limitations" boilerplate, its empty
 * regulatory sections, and the brand tagline it repeats after the tagline
 * already on the letterhead. Reading `report_data` directly here would put all
 * three back, which is the single strongest reason this adapter goes through the
 * normaliser rather than the row.
 *
 * ## The brand name is an input, not decoration
 *
 * `cleanLayerContent` needs it to strip the duplicated tagline, so the
 * organisation is loaded *before* the report is built rather than merged in
 * afterwards as the other adapters do. Passing an empty name would silently
 * disable one of the three strips.
 *
 * ## The audience is a render decision
 *
 * A stored report can be issued as a `general`, `investor` or `homebuyer`
 * edition, and the difference is the closing panels on the suburb layer —
 * nothing the model wrote changes. So `variant` selects the edition and the same
 * row serves three documents, where the legacy generator could only reach the
 * second by running the whole eight-layer pipeline again.
