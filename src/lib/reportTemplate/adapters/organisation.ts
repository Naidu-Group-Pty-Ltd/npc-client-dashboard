/**
 * The deployment's organisation, loaded once per page rather than per adapter
 * call.
 *
 * Every one of the five production adapters needs the same single row, and a
 * preview surface renders many templates in a row — the Template Library grid
 * builds a binding context per card. Without the cache that is one round trip
 * per card for a row that changes when somebody edits the Branding page.
 *
 * Deliberately a module-level promise rather than a TTL cache: the value is
 * stable for the life of a page, and an operator who has just edited their
 * branding reloads to see it, which is how the rest of the Branding surface
 * behaves already.
 *
 * A failure resolves to `null`, never throws, and is **not** cached — a
 * transient RLS or network error must not blank the letterhead for the rest of
 * the session. `applyOrganisationProjection` treats null as "publish nothing",
 * which leaves the bindings exactly as they were before this existed.
 *
 * ## Two clients, on purpose
 *
 * `whitelabel_settings` is deliberately public — its policy is "Anyone can view
 * whitelabel settings", granted to PUBLIC — so the wordmark and the logo load
 * on the anon client and always did.
 *
 * `global_report_settings` is not. It grants SELECT to `authenticated` and
 * `service_role` only, and the Command Centre has no Supabase Auth session, so
 * that read has to go through the staff-session gateway
 * (`getAuthenticatedSupabaseClient`). Reading it on the anon client does not
 * fail — PostgREST returns `200 []` — which is how the disclaimer, the ABN and
 * the postal address came to be missing from every design-system document
 * while the letterhead beside them looked fine.

/**
 * The tenant's brand marks, fetched and inlined.
 *
 * ## Why this did not exist
 *
 * The legacy render routes have resolved a mark from `whitelabel_settings.
 * logo_config` for a while — `assets.pure.ts` decides whether one may be used
 * and `fetchBrandAssets.ts` reads the bytes. The design-system path never did:
 * `tryRouteThroughTemplateBuilder` passes no `brand` at all, so every adapter
 * built `brand: { logo: null }` and no template could bind a mark even if it
 * wanted to. Binding one without this would have put an unresolved path on 543
 * covers, which renders as the empty string.
 *
 * ## Two slots, because the mark is not inverted
 *
 * `report` is the lockup for ivory paper, `report-mono` the one for an obsidian
 * ground. `ASSET_FALLBACK` walks the tenant's other uploads when the preferred
 * one is missing, and a key that fails policy does not stop the walk.
 *
 * Inlined rather than linked. `renderResourcePolicy` would admit a project
 * storage URL, but a `data:` URI is what makes the render network-free and
 * reproducible — the same reason `assets.pure.ts` gives at length.
 *
 * Never throws, and a failure is not cached: a logo that could not be fetched
 * is a thinner document, not a failed one.
