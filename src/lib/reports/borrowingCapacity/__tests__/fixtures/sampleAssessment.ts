/**
 * One fictional assessment, shared by every Borrowing Capacity test.
 *
 * It lives here rather than inside a spec because two things need to agree
 * about it: the golden capture of the shipping generator
 * (`src/components/borrowing-capacity/__tests__/snapshotGolden.spec.ts`) and
 * the payload contract that replaces it. If they drift, the golden stops being
 * a comparison and becomes decoration.
 *
 * **Fictional, and it must stay that way.** A golden is written to disk,
 * rasterised and pasted into review threads. Real client financials must never
 * be the thing that gets shared.
 *
 * ## Every field name here was read from its producer
 *
 * Four drafts of this fixture were written from summaries of the code instead
 * of the code, and each one produced plausible, wrong output — rows all
 * labelled "Income", 100% shading on everything, `Rate NaN%`. The provenance of
 * each shape is noted where it is not obvious. When adding to it, open the
 * producer.
 */

/**
 * The audit trail, as `calculate-borrowing-capacity` builds it.
 *
 * `category` is lowercase singular (`index.ts:194`); `action` is one of the
 * strings passed at the `audit.add(…)` call sites (`:1639`–`:1674`) — **not** a
 * free-text verb, because `audit.pure.ts` keys its unit and polarity tables on
 * it; `rawValue`/`assessedValue`/`delta` are numbers; the summary keys are the
 * four the renderer reads (`:214`–`:217`).
 *
 * The entries below are chosen to cover the interesting cases rather than to be
 * a plausible trail:
 *
 *  - `income/shading_applied` — an ordinary annual money pair.
 *  - `expense/hem_benchmark_applied` — a **monthly** pair, in the same table as
 *    the annual ones, and one whose positive delta *reduces* capacity.
 *  - `liability/credit_card_limit_rate` — a balance against a monthly
 *    repayment: two different units, and therefore no meaningful delta.
 *  - `policy/override_applied` — an interest **rate**, the entry the shipping
 *    report prints as "$6 → $9".
 *  - `policy/lender_profile_selected` — two zeroes that mean "not applicable".

 *
 * `lmi_mode` is one of `none | display_deduction | debt_capitalised` — the

 *
 * The fourth income row carries `shadingRate: 0` deliberately: income the lender
 * counts none of. Every `||`-based reader in the repo turns that into 100%.
 *
 * The lines add up to the totals, as the engine's would where nothing was
 * changed in the calculator (§21): the income rows to $186,000 and $171,400,
 * and the three liabilities with the capitalised premium's repayment — $18,640
 * at 8.65% over 30 years, $145.31 a month — to the $1,310 of commitments. Until
 * 1 Oct 2026 they did not, by $9,000, $10,600 and $2,165, and every document
 * drawn from this fixture printed a total its own rows did not reach.
 * `net_purchase_capacity` is the capacity less the premium, as both the
 * calculator and the engine write it.
