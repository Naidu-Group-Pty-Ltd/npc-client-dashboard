/**
 * The new document against the one that ships today.
 *
 * Phase 0 captured the shipping jsPDF generator against a fictional fixture and
 * wrote it to `reports/golden/`. This renders the *replacement* from the same
 * fixture and asserts the thing that actually matters about a migration: **the
 * new document says everything the old one said, and says it correctly.**
 *
 * Both halves are needed. "Nothing was dropped" without "and the figures are
 * right" passes for a document that reproduces the old one's defects; "the
 * figures are right" without "nothing was dropped" passes for a document that
 * lost its audit trail.
 *
 * The old side is the jsPDF byte stream, which for base-14 fonts carries its
 * text literally — which is why the Phase 0 capture could assert on it at all.
