/**
 * Asking the server for a 10 Year Cash Flow Analysis.
 *
 * ## What crosses the wire
 *
 * The projection the modal is showing, as plain numbers. Not the overrides, not
 * the report id and a hope the server recomputes the same thing — the actual
 * ten years on screen. `CashFlowAnalysisModal` lets an adviser edit any of ten
 * fields in any of ten years without saving, so "recompute it server-side" and
 * "render what the adviser reviewed" are different documents, and only one of
 * them is the one they meant to send.
 *
 * Units are attached on the server (`normalise.pure.ts`), which is why every
 * value here is a bare number: there is one place that decides that a rate of
 * `5` means five percent, and it is not this file.
 *
 * ## The fallback, and why it is narrow
 *
 * `render-cash-flow-pdf` has to be deployed and its migration applied before it
 * can answer. Between merging this and doing those, the button would fail. So a
 * missing *function* — and only that — falls back to the jsPDF generator that
 * ships today, and says which one the caller got.
 *
 * A 400 from a deployed function is a real failure and must surface as one. A
 * 500 likewise: falling back on it would hand a client a document produced by
 * the generator this format exists to replace, while telling nobody.

// The predicate is shared (`../undeployedRoute`). This module carried its own
// copy which could not match the message the transport actually produces for an
// absent function, so the in-browser generator handed in as `legacyFallback`
// was never called and the adviser got a red toast and NO FILE. See that
// module's header for why the substring arms were dead on every browser.

/**
 * Request the document.
 *
 * `legacyFallback` is passed in rather than imported so this module does not
 * drag the jsPDF generator into every bundle that touches the button.
 *
 * ## The Template Builder route here is guarded, not automatic
 *
 * Every other migrated format asks `tryTemplateDocument` first and renders an
 * activated template instead of calling its flowing route. This one may not ask
 * unconditionally, and the reason is the first line of this module's contract:
 * **the projection is an argument, not a lookup.**
 *
 * It arrives from `CashFlowAnalysisModal`, which recomputes ten years in the
 * browser from the report's `manual_overrides` plus whatever the adviser has
 * changed since the modal opened. `cashFlowAdapter` cannot see any of that — it
 * reads the stored `financial_calculations.projections`, a different series
 * whenever an override exists, which is the normal case for the reports this
 * modal is opened on. Asking regardless would hand the client a document whose
 * numbers are not the numbers the adviser is looking at while they send it, and
 * a wrong figure in a client's financial report outranks a nicer layout.
 *
 * So `storedSeriesMatch.ts` has to name a stored scenario first — every field
 * both series state, in every year, plus a cash-flow column that corresponds
 * consistently — and the modal asks only then, for that scenario. It answers
 * null for anything it cannot be certain of.
 * `cashFlowTemplateRouteGuarded.spec.ts` keeps the guard attached to the call.
