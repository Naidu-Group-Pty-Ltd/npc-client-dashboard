/**
 * The modal's projection, as the render route wants it.
 *
 * A rename and a reshape, and nothing else — no arithmetic. That is the whole
 * point of keeping it here instead of inline in a 6,000-line component: the
 * mapping from `YearlyProjection` to the wire is the one place a field can be
 * silently dropped, and it is small enough to read in one screen and test.
 *
 * Two decisions worth naming:
 *
 *  - **Year 0 is not a projected year.** The modal computes eleven rows, and
 *    the first is the settlement position with every cash-flow figure forced to
 *    zero. Printing it as "Year 0" in a client's projection table puts a row of
 *    zeroes at the head of the document; it belongs in the acquisition block,
 *    where it already is.
 *  - **Rates arrive percent-scaled.** The modal multiplies by 100 before it
 *    stores them (`capitalGrowthRate: yearCapitalGrowthRate * 100`), so `5`
 *    means five percent all the way through. The server's `percent` unit means
 *    the same thing, so nothing is converted here — which is the only reason
 *    that is safe to say.
