/**
 * "Failed to parse AI analysis" was never true.
 *
 * An adviser comparing properties on the Cash Flow Analysis page pressed
 * Generate and got that sentence every time. The model answered, and answered
 * in JSON. Four things in the producer caused it, and this file pins each one
 * so none can come back:
 *
 *   1. 4,000 output tokens for an eight-section schema, shared with a reasoning
 *      model's own thinking;
 *   2. no `response_format` at all, so the shape was a request rather than a
 *      constraint;
 *   3. a fence regex that required a CLOSING fence, so a cut-off answer was
 *      handed to `JSON.parse` with the opening fence still attached;
 *   4. `finish_reason` never read, so "it ran out of room" was reported as "it
 *      did not answer with JSON" — which sends an operator to the wrong remedy.
