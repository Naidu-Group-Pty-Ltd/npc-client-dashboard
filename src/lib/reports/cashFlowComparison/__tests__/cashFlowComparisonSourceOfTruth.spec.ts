/**
 * The Cash Flow Comparison must have exactly one implementation.
 *
 * The same guard the four formats before it carry, with one deliberate
 * relaxation: a module here may import `../cashFlow/*.pure.ts` as well as its
 * own siblings.
 *
 * That is not a loophole, it is the design. This format's payload is N of the
 * 10 Year Cash Flow's payload — a `ComparedProperty` holds a
 * `CashFlowProjection` and the normaliser calls `buildProjection` once per
 * property. Declaring a second, comparison-flavoured projected year would create
 * two answers to "what is a projected year", and the two would drift on the
 * first field either side added.
 *
 * The rule the original states — "Edge Functions cannot resolve it" — does not
 * bite: `../cashFlow/` is inside `_shared`, so the edge runtime resolves it the
 * same way it resolves a sibling. The allowance is exactly that one directory,
 * asserted below, so it cannot quietly become "any other format".
