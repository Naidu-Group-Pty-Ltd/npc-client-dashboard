/**
 * Asking the server for a typeset Cash Flow Comparison Analysis.
 *
 * ## No legacy fallback, and here that is a decision rather than a limitation
 *
 * `requestCashFlowPdf` falls back to its in-browser generator when the route is
 * absent, because for that format the two renderers produce the same document
 * from the same inputs.
 *
 * They do not here. The two legacy generators produce genuinely different
 * documents: `exportComparisonPDF` rasterises three on-screen charts and prints
 * an eight-row metrics table, and `exportAiAnalysisPDF` prints the model's prose
 * and nothing else — and draws nothing at all when there is no analysis.
 * Silently substituting either for this one would hand a client a document
 * nobody chose. So a deployment gap means one new menu item does not work yet,
 * and it says so, naming the buttons that do.
 *
 * ## What crosses the wire
 *
 * Every property's projected years as plain numbers, and the analysis object if
 * the adviser generated one. Not the nine metrics — the server derives those, so
 * that the ranking cannot disagree with the tables beneath it. Not the
 * addresses either: those are read from `investment_reports`, because the label
 * on a column of someone's financial projection is not a display preference.
