/**
 * The Cash Flow Comparison must have exactly one implementation.
 *
 * The same guard the four formats before it carry, with one deliberate
 * relaxation: a module here may import `../cashFlow/*.pure.ts` as well as its
 * own siblings.
 *
 * That is not a loophole, it is the design. This format's payload is N of the
 * 10 Year Cash Flow's payload — a `ComparedProperty` holds a
 * `CashFlowProjection` and the normaliser calls `buildProjection` once per
 * property. Declaring a second, comparison-flavoured projected year would create
 * two answers to "what is a projected year", and the two would drift on the
 * first field either side added.
 *
 * The rule the original states — "Edge Functions cannot resolve it" — does not
 * bite: `../cashFlow/` is inside `_shared`, so the edge runtime resolves it the
 * same way it resolves a sibling. The allowance is exactly that one directory,
 * asserted below, so it cannot quietly become "any other format".

 *
 * It earns its place on this rule's own logic. The constraint is that the edge
 * runtime must resolve every import, and `clientName.ts` is inside `_shared`
 * exactly as `reportDesign/` is — the render routes already import it there.
 * What it holds is the repo's one casing rule for a person's name, which
 * exists because two report routes each invented their own spelling of these
 * columns and one of them 404'd for every client in the database. This format
 * printing "sachin mathew" while the legacy generator printed "Sachin Mathew"
 * was the same class of divergence, and the fix is to share that function
 * rather than to restate it here.
 *
 * `../reportDate.pure.ts` is the shared date reader, a file in the parent
 * like the others here — eleven routes each carried a private copy.
 * `../readableFileName.pure.ts` is the one rule every typeset format names its
