/**
 * Asking the server for a typeset Client Details report.
 *
 * ## One id crosses the wire
 *
 * Not the client's details. Every figure in this document is a persisted row in
 * one of nine tables, so the route reads them itself — which is the difference
 * between this format and the cash flow ones, where the arithmetic lives in a
 * modal against overrides nobody has saved.
 *
 * It also means the document does not depend on which screen asked for it. A
 * report produced from what a component happened to have fetched is a report
 * whose contents vary by route taken; this one cannot.
 *
 * ## No legacy fallback
 *
 * `requestCashFlowPdf` falls back to its in-browser generator when the route is
 * absent, because for that format the two renderers produce the same document
 * from the same inputs.
 *
 * Here they produce genuinely different documents — one is a stack of pictures
 * of the other's ancestor — so substituting either would send a broker something
 * nobody chose. A deployment gap means the new menu item does not work yet, and
 * it says so, naming the buttons that do.
