/**
 * Asking the server for a Commercial & Industrial Capacity Report.
 *
 * One function behind every button that produces this document, so the two
 * surfaces that offer it — the assessment's results step and the row action on
 * the assessments list — cannot drift into asking for different things.
 *
 * ## No legacy fallback, on purpose
 *
 * The Snapshot's equivalent carries one, because that format had five shipping
 * in-browser generators and merging the server path before deploying the route
 * would have broken every download button in the product
 * (`docs/reports/BORROWING_CAPACITY.md` §10).
 *
 * This format has no such generator. What it replaces is `window.print()` on a
 * print-styled results screen — not a document, a screenshot of an application
 * — and falling back to that would hand a client a page with the app's
 * navigation chrome in it under the name of a finance report. A missing
 * function is an error here, and it says which two deployment steps are
 * outstanding.
