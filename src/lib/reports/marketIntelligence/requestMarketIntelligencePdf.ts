/**
 * Asking the server for a typeset Market Intelligence report.
 *
 * ## What crosses the wire, and what deliberately does not
 *
 * A report id. **Not the payload.** The legacy path casts
 * `report.report_data` straight to its own interface
 * (`MarketIntelligenceHistoryModal.tsx:70`) and typesets whatever arrives; this
 * route reads `marketing_intelligence_reports` itself.
 *
 * That is not only a validation argument. It is also why the document no longer
 * depends on which screen asked for it: the export button had the correlation
 * block in memory and the History modal never could, so the same report
 * produced two different PDFs depending on where you pressed the button.
 *
 * ## No legacy fallback
 *
 * `requestCashFlowPdf` falls back to its in-browser generator when the route is
 * absent, because for that format the two renderers produce the same document
 * from the same inputs.
 *
 * Here they do not. The legacy lists empty layers in its contents and prints
 * nothing for them, has no ceiling on a 244,332-character layer, and fills its
 * cover with a hardcoded navy rather than the tenant's brand. Substituting it
 * would send somebody a different document from the one they chose. A
 * deployment gap means the new control does not work yet, and it says so,
 * naming the button that does.
