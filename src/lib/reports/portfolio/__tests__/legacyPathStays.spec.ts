/**
 * The legacy Portfolio Analysis generator is not deprecated, and this is what
 * stops it becoming so.
 *
 * The guard matters more here than it did for the Snapshot, and for the opposite
 * reason. That format's two renderers produce the same document from the same
 * inputs, so the risk was that the older one quietly stopped being reachable.
 * Here the older one is the *only* one that exists as a component — 3,878 lines,
 * three mount sites, zero test coverage — and the new path was built beside it
 * precisely because it has no importable entry point to share.
 *
 * So the assertions below are two claims, not one:
 *
 *   1. The generator, its borrowed section pack and all three mount sites are
 *      still there and still wired up. Nothing in this migration touched that
 *      file, which is a stronger guarantee than the other two formats got — and
 *      a guarantee worth keeping true.
 *   2. The new path is genuinely additional: it never runs the generator, never
 *      falls back to it, and never writes over the file it produced.
 *
 * These are structural assertions on source rather than renders, because that is
 * the property that matters. A behavioural test of one button cannot say
 * anything about three mount sites and a 3,878-line component.
