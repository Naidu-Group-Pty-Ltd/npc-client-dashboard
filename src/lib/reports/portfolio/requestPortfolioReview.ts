/**
 * Asking the server for a Portfolio Performance Review.
 *
 * One function behind every button that produces the typeset document.
 *
 * ## No fallback, unlike the Snapshot
 *
 * `requestSnapshot.ts` falls back to the in-browser generator when its route is
 * absent, because for that format the two renderers produce the same document
 * from the same inputs and a deployment gap would otherwise break five working
 * buttons.
 *
 * Neither half of that holds here. `PortfolioAnalysisPDFGenerator` has **no
 * importable entry point** — the only way to reach it is to mount the component
 * and click through *Generate* then *Download & Save* — so there is nothing this
 * module could call. And nothing is being replaced: the legacy flow keeps every
 * button it has today, and this is an additional one. A deployment gap here
 * means one new menu item does not work yet, and it says so, naming the button
 * that does.
 *
 * That is the stronger position. Handing someone a document produced by a
 * different renderer than the one they asked for is what both prior formats
 * refused to do, and here we do not even have the option.
