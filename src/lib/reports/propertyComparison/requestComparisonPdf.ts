/**
 * Asking the server for a typeset Property Comparison Analysis.
 *
 * ## No legacy fallback, and here that is not even a choice
 *
 * `requestSnapshot.ts` falls back to its in-browser generator when the route is
 * absent, because for that format the two renderers produce the same document
 * from the same inputs.
 *
 * Neither half holds here. `ComparisonPDFGenerator` has **no importable entry
 * point** — it is a React component that calls an edge function and then mounts
 * `PixelPerfectPDFGenerator`, which exposes only a ref handle returning a URL —
 * so there is no function this module could call. And nothing is being replaced:
 * the existing button keeps working everywhere it works today, and this is an
 * additional one. A deployment gap means one new menu item does not work yet, and
 * it says so, naming the button that does.
 *
 * ## What the two paths actually differ on
 *
 * Worth stating because the UI says it too: the legacy path asks a model to
 * rewrite the stored analysis as markdown on **every** download, so it spends
 * report credits and the wording differs each time. This one typesets the row.
 * Free, and the same twice.
