  ANSWER,
  `## The short answer

At **+1%** the position moves from marginally negative to about **-$9,400** a year before tax.

### Where it lands

| Scenario | Annual position |
| --- | ---: |
| Today | -$2,180 |
| Rates +1% | -$9,420 |

The buffer covers it for eleven months, which is the number that matters.`,
  `## Against the precinct

Fees run **$6,840** a year against a precinct median of $5,200 for comparable stock.

### Why the gap

- The building carries a lift and a pool, and the sinking fund reflects both
- Two of the four lots are owner-occupied, which historically resists fee restraint

> The premium is real, and it is priced into the rent only in part.`,
  `## On structure

A two-year fix at the current sheet rate costs about **$1,900** more over the term than staying variable.

### What you are buying

- Certainty across the two years the buffer is thinnest
- The right to walk at the end without a break cost

The alternative is a split, which halves both the cost and the certainty.`,
  `## What would make this wrong

Three things, in the order they would show.

### The list

| Signal | Where to watch it |
| --- | --- |
| Vacancy above 3% | Quarterly rental report |
| A second fee rise | The AGM minutes |

> If two of the three appear inside a year, revisit rather than hold.`,
