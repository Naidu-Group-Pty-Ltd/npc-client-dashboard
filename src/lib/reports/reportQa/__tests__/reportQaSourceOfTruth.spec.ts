/**
 * The Report Q&A export must have exactly one implementation.
 *
 * The same guard the six formats before it carry, with one relaxation: the
 * shared `../text.pure.ts` and `../markdown.pure.ts`, where `neutraliseUrls` and
 * the Markdown parser live now that two formats each need them. Those are
 * **files** and not a directory, which is what stops it reading as "the parent
 * directory is open now" — the assertion at the bottom pins it.
 *
 * The guard matters more here than anywhere else in the programme. This format
 * has four legacy implementations across three libraries, two of them near-
 * verbatim copies of a third that have since drifted apart — one uses a fixed
 * `rowHeight` where the other measures, so multi-line table cells overlap in one
 * and not the other. Four copies is how that happens, and one is how it stops.
