/**
 * Asking the server for a typeset Report Q&A document.
 *
 * ## What crosses the wire, and what deliberately does not
 *
 * A conversation id and which of the three documents is wanted. **Not the
 * messages.** The legacy path posts them up from browser state
 * (`ReportQA.tsx:2042`) and typesets whatever arrives; this route reads
 * `report_qa_conversations` and `report_qa_messages` itself, because a
 * transcript the caller supplies is a transcript the caller can edit, and this
 * document's whole claim is that it is a record of what was asked and what was
 * said.
 *
 * It also means the document does not depend on which screen asked for it, or
 * on how much of the conversation that screen had loaded.
 *
 * ## No legacy fallback
 *
 * `requestCashFlowPdf` falls back to its in-browser generator when the route is
 * absent, because for that format the two renderers produce the same document
 * from the same inputs.
 *
 * Here they do not. Substituting a jsPDF export whose tables overlap
 * (`ConversationReportEditor.tsx:268`), whose smart punctuation has been
 * transliterated to ASCII, and whose cover is our letterhead rather than the
 * tenant's, would send somebody a different document from the one they chose. A
 * deployment gap means the new control does not work yet, and it says so,
 * naming the exports that do.
