/**
 * The contents page, across every format that declares one.
 *
 * `toc` does not draw the list it is handed. It walks the document's own
 * rendered pages and sets one row per page, with that page's real name and real
 * number — which is why a conditional page dropping out still leaves the
 * numbering correct.
 *
 * `title` is the block's *heading*, and it used to be given
 * `entries.join('\n')`. A `<div>` collapses newlines, so every contents page in
 * the seven formats that declare one printed all twelve section names as a
 * single run-on line at heading size, immediately above the real list:
 *
 *   "The verdict Executive summary The ranking The scorecard Money · return,
 *    cash flow Location · catchment, amenity Risk · exposure, reward …"
 *
 * The height was wrong for the same reason the list was: it counted the section
 * names, while the renderer counts pages. A Property Comparison draws 17 pages
 * from a 12-name list, and the block declared height for 12 — so it ran past
 * the footer on `ap-03`, found by rendering a stored production row.
