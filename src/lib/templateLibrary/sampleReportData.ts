/**
 * Sample report data for Template Library previews.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A template catalogue that shows abstract grey rectangles is asking the reader
 * to imagine the product. This dataset lets the browse and preview surfaces run
 * each template through the **real** production renderer, so what a user sees is
 * the actual document they would produce — same pipeline, same typography, same
 * palette as the PDF — with the fields filled in.
 *
 * ## It is sample data, and it says so
 *
 * Nothing here is real and nothing here is a customer's. Every surface that
 * renders it labels it as sample, because a preview that looks like live data
 * is worse than no preview: someone will screenshot it. The one rule this file
 * follows without exception is that it is used for **preview only** and is never
 * written into a report, a template, or the database.
 *
 * ## Conventions that matter
 *
 * - The `percent` filter formats the number it is given and does **not**
 *   multiply by 100. A 3.84% yield is `3.84`, not `0.0384`. Getting this wrong
 *   renders "0.04%".
 * - `currency` takes a raw number, not a preformatted string.
 * - Indexed bindings (`risks.0.action`) resolve through ordinary arrays.
 *
 * ## One scenario, told consistently
 *
 * Every namespace describes the same fictional engagement — the Nguyen family
 * buying in Leichhardt through Meridian Property Advisory — so a user flicking
 * between templates sees one coherent story rather than forty unrelated
 * fragments. That consistency is most of what makes a preview feel considered.

/**
 * The same four holdings the voice templates print, in the vocabulary

 * ## Derived, not transcribed
 *
 * `portfolio.holdings` below already states each property's value, debt, yield
 * and **annual** net position, and the Compass masters need the same portfolio
 * expressed **monthly**, per-property and totalled. Writing that out twice is
 * how two pages of one preview come to disagree, so everything monthly here is
 * computed from the annual figures rather than typed beside them.
 *
 * The annuals are the anchors because they are anchored elsewhere: the
 * Leichhardt holding's −$21,476 is −$413 a week × 52, which `cashflow` states
 * and several templates print. A 52-week year does not divide into twelfths, so
 * the monthly figures carry cents; every template sets them with `| currency`,
 * which rounds to whole dollars, and the rounded rows total the rounded total.
 *
 * `monthlyExpenses` is the residual — rent less the net position — and so
 * includes debt servicing. At $2.088m of debt that is about $10.4k a month of
 * interest plus roughly $2.4k of holding costs, which is the shape a real
 * portfolio of this gearing has.

/**
 * The 10 Year Cash Flow sample, built the way production builds it.
 *
 * ## Run through the projection rather than written out
 *
 * Every other namespace in this file is typed by hand, and for most of them
 * that is right. This one is not: the Compass masters bind
 * `cashflow.outcome.equityGrowthLessShortfall`,
 * `cashflow.outcome.valueGrowthPercent` and eight fields across ten years in
 * three scenarios — 240 numbers plus a dozen derivations. Typing them means the
 * preview can disagree with what the adapter would produce, and the disagreement
 * would be invisible: every figure would still look like a figure.
 *
 * So this states a **`financial_calculations` blob shaped exactly as
 * `investment_reports` stores one** and runs `projectCashFlow` over it, which is
 * the same call `cashFlowAdapter` makes. The preview is then the adapter's
 * output by construction, and a change to the projection moves the preview with
 * it rather than leaving it stale.
 *
 * ## The figures are the same engagement, at production's magnitudes
 *
 * The Leichhardt holding the rest of this file describes: $1.285m, an $1.028m
 * loan at 6.14%. Growth rates differ per scenario and nothing else does, which
 * is what the stored projections do — the loan amortises identically in all
 * three. The resulting series sit inside every range measured across the 162
 * stored projections: cash flow negative in every year, cumulative cash flow
 * reaching −$333k by year ten, and return running from 9% to 24%.

 * the 2-to-5 range the normaliser enforces, so the preview exercises the
 * property-count variants rather than either end of them.
 *
 * The analysis half is present, because a preview of the pages that only exist
 * when a model wrote something is worth more than a preview without them. The

  // sample longer than production is the same defect as a sample shorter than
  // it, and it is caught by the same measure.
