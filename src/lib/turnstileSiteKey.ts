/**
 * The one place that decides which Turnstile widget this build renders.
 *
 * A Turnstile widget IS a (site key, secret) pair. The site key is public and
 * is rendered by the browser; the secret lives in the backend and is what
 * `siteverify` checks the resulting token against. A token minted by one
 * widget does not verify against another widget's secret, and — this is the
 * part that matters — a token minted by ONE tenant's widget verifies perfectly
 * well against ANOTHER tenant's backend if both were handed the same pair.
 * Cloudflare returns the hostname the challenge was solved on and no login
 * handler in this repository reads it.
 *
 * The site key used to be a literal in `components/auth/TurnstileWidget.tsx`.
 * That is fine for this deployment, whose widget it is, and it is exactly
 * wrong for every deployment mirrored from this one: `npc-client-dashboard`
 * inherited the literal verbatim and rendered this deployment's widget on a
 * different tenant's login page, which is one credential, one rotation and one
 * domain allowlist spanning tenants that are supposed to be separate.
 *
 * ── The pairing rule ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `integrations/supabase/env.ts` already reasons about this shape for the
 * Supabase URL and its anon key. The same rule settles it here: the built-in
 * site key is used ONLY when this build talks to the backend that key's secret
 * lives in. A fork pointed at its own Supabase project therefore stops using
 * this widget without anybody having to remember to unset anything — the
 * failure mode becomes a visible "not configured" rather than a silent share.
 *
 * Aurixa Mission Control mints each clone its own widget and publishes the
 * site key as `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`.
