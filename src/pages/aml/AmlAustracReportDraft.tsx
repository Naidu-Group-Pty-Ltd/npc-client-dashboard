/**
 * Writing an AUSTRAC report — a page of its own.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The draft was a modal. Everything about it was wrong for what it holds:
 * a report to a regulator is the longest single piece of writing anyone
 * does in this product, it is written against a statutory deadline, and it
 * is frequently started, left, and returned to hours later. A dialog cannot
 * be deep-linked, cannot be reopened where it was left, cannot be sent to a
 * colleague, is not reached by the browser's back button — and closes on an
 * outside click or the Escape key with whatever was in it.
 *
 * Everything the dialog asked, this asks. Everything the server refuses, it
 * still refuses. What changed is that the draft now has a URL, room for the
 * narrative, and the reasons for the report in view beside it while it is
 * written rather than competing with it for a modal's worth of height.
 *
 * ── Leaving is not losing ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The one thing a page gives up is the modal's implicit "you are in the
 * middle of something", so the page says it: an unsaved change guards both
 * the browser's own unload and this page's own Back, because a narrative
 * somebody spent twenty minutes on is not recoverable from anywhere.
