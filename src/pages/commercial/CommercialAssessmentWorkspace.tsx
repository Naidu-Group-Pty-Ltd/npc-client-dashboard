/**
 * Commercial & Industrial assessment workspace.
 *
 * A full-page, autosaving, step-by-step workspace — the replacement for the
 * narrow scrolling modal the feature used to create properties through. Steps
 * are directly navigable rather than strictly sequential, because a user
 * revisiting an assessment usually knows which section they came back for.
 *
 * This is the module's one workflow. The "Standalone calculators" workspace
 * edited these same records through a second set of stages; its valuation and
 * forecast are now the optional "Valuation & forecast" step here, its property
 * link is the register panel on the Property step, and its route redirects to
 * this page. See `docs/commercial/MODULE_STRUCTURE.md`.
