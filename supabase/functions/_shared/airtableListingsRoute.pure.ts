/**
 * Where a Listings & Overview Airtable read goes, and what it carries.
 *
 * ## Why a deployment might not hold the token at all
 *
 * The Listings and Overview pages are built from one table — `Property Intake
 * Master` in the `NPC Emails` base — and every clone shows the SAME
 * marketplace, so every clone needs the same token and the same base id. The
 * fleet-wide answer was to forward all six `AIRTABLE_*` names to every clone.
 *
 * An Airtable personal access token carries its whole scope: a set of BASES
 * and a set of PERMISSIONS, fixed when it was minted. Nothing in the
 * credential narrows it to one table. So a forwarded token on a tenant's
 * Supabase project reaches every base its scope admits — and if that scope
 * includes `data.records:write`, it can rewrite the shared intake table every
 * other clone reads. Airtable has no per-tenant sub-credential to mint.
 *
 * The credential therefore stops travelling and the CALL travels instead:
 * Mission Control holds the one token and the one base id, and runs the read
 * on a tenant's behalf, authenticated by the Mission Control key the clone
 * already has. The prime is the account holder and still reads Airtable
 * directly.
 *
 * ## The three rules
 *
 * **The direct route requires the vendor token and nothing else decides it.**
 * A deployment holding `AIRTABLE_TOKEN` is one entitled to spend it — that is
 * the prime, and any future deployment given its own Airtable account.
 *
 * **A brokered read must NOT be metered here.** Mission Control writes the
 * usage row because Mission Control made the vendor call. Metering at both
 * ends bills the tenant twice, which this platform's own rule names as worse
 * than not billing at all. `meter` is what carries that.
 *
 * **A brokered route holds no base id, structurally.** The `broker` branch of
 * `ListingsRoute` has no `baseId` field, so `listingsRequestUrl` cannot put
 * one in a brokered URL even by mistake. Mission Control's own rule is that
 * the base is its and the caller never names one; this is the clone-side half
 * of that rule, enforced by the type rather than by a comment.
 *
 * ## Reads travel. The write-back does not.
 *
 * Two functions PATCH this base: `listing-images` writes the durable image
 * URLs into the enrichment column, and `listing-enrichment` writes resolved
 * field values. Both are correct on the prime, which owns the base, and both
 * are wrong from a clone for a reason that has nothing to do with secrecy:
 * every clone reads the SAME table, and what a clone would write are signed
 * URLs into ITS OWN bucket. Publishing those into the shared record hands
 * every other tenant links that are useless to them and were never theirs to
 * hold.
 *
 * So the broker is read-only by construction and stays that way — adding a
 * write operation would hand a tenant the ability to rewrite the table every
 * other tenant reads, which is the leak this whole arrangement exists to
 * close. `resolveWritebackRoute` is the other half: a deployment that does
 * not hold the token is REFUSED with the rule, not reported as
 * misconfigured, because there is nothing here for an operator to fix.
 *
 * Pure: no Deno, so the frontend tests import it too.
