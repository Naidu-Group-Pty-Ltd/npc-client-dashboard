/**
 * A partner's filing cabinet — the matters they hold a Passport on.
 *
 * ── What this is for ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A partner accumulates Passports. A broker acts on many purchases, a
 * builder sells many lots, a conveyancer runs many matters, and every one of
 * them may carry a Compliance Passport from the issuing organisation. The
 * compliance page showed them as a row of chips labelled
 * **"Matter …6a5a49"** — the last six characters of a database identifier —
 * which names nothing a partner recognises and does not scale past about
 * four.
 *
 * This turns those links into a list a person can actually file by: what the
 * matter IS, whose record it is, and whether there is anything to read.
 *
 * ── The disclosure rule, which is the whole point ─────────────────────
 * **A partner is told whose record it is only where they may READ that
 * record.** The customer's name and the case reference are printed on page
 * one of the Passport itself, so naming them on a matter whose Passport is
 * disclosable discloses nothing new. Naming them on a matter where the
 * Passport is withheld — never shared, withdrawn, lapsed — WOULD be a new
 * disclosure, made by a list rather than by a decision.
 *
 * So a withheld row falls back to the partner's OWN reference (their purchase
 * file, their legal matter) and then to the date they were linked. It says
 * there is nothing to read yet; it does not say who it is about.
 *
 * Three rules carry it.
 *
 * **The label is the partner's own vocabulary first.** Their purchase file or
 * legal matter number is the thing they filed it under; the issuing
 * organisation's case reference is a foreign key to them. Where both exist,
 * theirs leads.
 *
 * **A search must match what is on screen.** The haystack is built from the
 * fields actually rendered, so a partner who can see a name can find it — and
 * a partner who cannot see it cannot search for it either, which is the same
 * disclosure rule applied to the search box.
 *
 * **Ordering is by usefulness, not by recency.** A matter with a readable
 * Passport comes before one waiting on the issuing organisation, which comes
 * before one that has ended. Within a group, most recently linked first.
