/**
 * What the loaded index covers, measured against the AML/CTF Rules.
 *
 * ── The question this answers ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * "10,783 people across 951 offices" is a number about a database. The
 * question an operator actually has is whether the thing that just returned
 * nothing had ever looked at judges, or ambassadors, or the Chief of Navy.
 *
 * A domestic PEP under the Rules is far broader than the federal Parliament:
 * Commonwealth, State and Territory legislators; the Governor-General,
 * Governors and Administrators; High Court, Federal Court and State/Territory
 * Supreme Court judges; accountable authorities of Commonwealth entities;
 * heads of State/Territory departments; heads of local government; specified
 * senior Defence positions; and specified Australian diplomatic positions.
 *
 * This maps the office titles the index actually holds onto that vocabulary,
 * so coverage is reported against the obligation rather than against a row
 * count.
 *
 * ── Why a classifier here is safe, when one was deleted next door ─────
 * A heuristic was removed from the APH parser last week for good reason: it
 * guessed where one office title ended and the next began, and a wrong guess
 * ALTERED the data.
 *
 * This one alters nothing. It reads titles and reports; every row is stored
 * exactly as the source published it whatever this says. And the two ways it
 * can be wrong are not symmetrical, which is what makes it usable:
 *
 *   - a title it does not recognise is counted as UNCLASSIFIED and disclosed,
 *     never as absent. So every count is a FLOOR — "at least N offices" — and
 *     the prose says so;
 *   - a category with nothing recognised reads as NOT EVIDENCED, which sends
 *     the operator to check by hand. That is the safe direction: the cost is
 *     a check somebody did not strictly need.
 *
 * The unsafe direction — claiming a category is covered when it is not — is
 * the one this file exists to prevent, and it is not hypothetical. See
 * `diplomatic` below.
