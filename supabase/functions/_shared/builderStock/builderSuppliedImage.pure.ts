/**
 * BUILDER STOCK — THE PICTURE A BUILDER HANDS OVER DIRECTLY.
 *
 * Every image this product serves is read out of something: a column that
 * names a URL, a brochure page that names a lot, a page cover, a design
 * brochure. That works until there is nothing to read — and on the one live
 * source, thirteen of twenty-six published properties attach no document at
 * all. The pipeline's own fallbacks then offered, for those rows, a Simonds
 * display home, an ABC Homes display home and the land developer's estate
 * marketing, and refused all of them, correctly. The cards stayed blank
 * because there was nothing to read, and no reader fixes that.
 *
 * The one party who certainly has the picture is the builder, and the product
 * had no way for them to hand it over. That is what this module is for.
 *
 * TWO ROUTES, ONE ACT. A builder supplies a picture either FOR A DESIGN — one
 * render, serving every row of theirs that states it — or FOR ONE PROPERTY.
 * The first is the leverage (three uploads cover those thirteen rows, and
 * every future row of those designs for ever); the second is the guarantee
 * (whatever else went wrong, somebody can fix one card).
 *
 * NEITHER INVENTS A LEVEL OR A STAGE. A builder-supplied image is stored as
 * `uploaded_document` / `source_supplied`, which is what it is: bytes the
 * builder gave us for this property. It therefore travels the existing ladder
 * unchanged — `isDisplayableSourceImage`, `rankImage`, `chooseCardImage`, the
 * marketplace eligibility gate — and a card drawing one truthfully says
 * "Builder supplied". In particular it goes through the promotional-overlay
 * rule like any other builder image: a render with "$25,000 REBATE" set over
 * it is refused here exactly as it is when it arrives inside a brochure, and
 * for the same reason.
 *
 * Pure: no IO, no clock, no network.

/**
 * The comparison key for a design name.
 *
 * Case, spacing and punctuation are removed, so `DK 22B`, `dk 22b` and
 * `DK-22B` are one design — which is how a builder types the same house into
 * twenty rows.
 */
/**
 * The design a stored row states, from the one place it can be.
 *
 * `house_design` is the canonical field. A row imported before the `HOUSE`
 * column was mappable carries it in `unmapped` instead — and those rows are
 * exactly the ones this feature exists for, so reading both means a builder
 * does not have to re-read their source before they can supply a render.
 * Re-reading it is still better, and the page says so.
 *
 * Shared because three callers must agree: the surface that offers a builder
 * their designs, the fan-out that attaches a render, and the settler that
 * applies one to stock imported later.
