/**
 * Builder stock — reading the package a stock row links to.
 *
 * A row of the live Notion list carries one link of its own: "Complete Package
 * Pack", a Google Drive folder. Forty-four of the forty-five rows without a
 * cover point at the SAME folder, so the link alone attributes nothing — it is
 * an estate's document library, not a property's photograph.
 *
 * What makes attribution deterministic is that the library NAMES its contents:
 *
 *     Tweed Heads/Tweed Heads Packages/Lot 43/Lot 43 - Stradbroke 180 - Property Package.pdf
 *
 * and the stock row is "Lot 43 — Tringa Street, Sandpiper Estate … [Stradbroke
 * 180]". The folder names the lot and the file names the lot AND the house
 * design, which together are exactly one stock row. That is the source stating
 * the relationship, not us inferring one from a resemblance.
 *
 * THE RULES THIS MODULE ENFORCES:
 *   • EXACTLY ONE, or nothing. One folder named for the lot, one file naming
 *     that lot and that design. Two candidates is not a near miss — it is the
 *     source declining to say, and the answer is no image.
 *   • NOTHING OUTSIDE THE LINKED FOLDER. Descent is bounded and downward only;
 *     no id is ever constructed, guessed or followed out of the tree the row
 *     itself pointed at.
 *
 * Pure: no imports, no IO, no clock.
