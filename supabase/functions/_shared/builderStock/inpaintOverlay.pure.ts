/**
 * Builder stock — the geometry of a masked repair, and the gate that proves it.
 *
 * The deterministic reconstruction in `sanitizeOverlay.pure.ts` refuses when a
 * badge sits over something structured or covers too much of the frame, because
 * solving Laplace's equation across a fifth of a photograph produces a smear
 * and a smear is worse than a blank card. This is what happens next: the same
 * mask, the same original bytes, and a model asked to reconstruct only what was
 * behind it.
 *
 * THE MODEL IS NEVER GIVEN THE PHOTOGRAPH AND NEVER GIVEN THE FRAME. It is
 * given a SQUARE PATCH cut around one overlay region, with enough surrounding
 * photograph to know what it is continuing, and a mask marking the part to
 * rebuild. Three reasons, and all three matter:
 *
 *   The endpoint returns a 1024-square image whatever it is sent. Handing it a
 *   whole 1200x800 photograph means receiving back a re-encoded, re-framed,
 *   re-scaled picture of the entire property — every pixel changed, the
 *   original's dimensions gone, and no way to tell a repaired badge from a
 *   redesigned roof.
 *
 *   A patch keeps the model's influence LOCAL. Whatever it does, it does inside
 *   a square that contains one graphic, and the rest of the builder's
 *   photograph was never in the request at all.
 *
 *   And it makes the guarantee arithmetic rather than a hope. What comes back
 *   is composited onto the original at the mask and nowhere else, so
 *   "everything outside the mask is pixel-identical" is not a property the
 *   model has to respect — it is a property of the compositing, checked
 *   afterwards over the whole frame by `outsidePermittedRegionUnchanged`.
 *
 * THE FEATHER IS THE ONE EXCEPTION AND IT IS TWO PIXELS. A hard mask edge shows
 * as a seam, because the returned patch has been through a different encoder
 * than the builder's file. A narrow linear blend just outside the mask removes
 * it. Those pixels are part of the PERMITTED region and the gate knows it;
 * everything beyond them must match the original byte for byte, and the gate
 * fails the whole repair if a single one does not.
 *
 * Pure: no imports, no IO, no clock, no network.

 * render it sits on. Too little and the patch is mostly graphic and the result
 * is invention; too much and the mask becomes a speck in a 1024-square and the
 * detail comes back soft.
 *
 * ADDITIVE, NOT MULTIPLICATIVE, AND PRODUCTION IS WHY. A margin of "twice the
 * graphic" is fine for a badge and absurd for a banner: Lot 13 Hummock Rise
 * carries two 460px pills on a 1200px frame, and at 2x each one demanded a
 * 920px square. The two squares then overlapped, merged, and became a single
 * patch covering the ENTIRE photograph — so the model was handed the whole

 * also required it to fit INSIDE the frame, so its side was capped at the
 * frame's short edge. A builder's status plates run across the width of a
 * landscape photograph — wider than it is tall — so no square inside the frame
 * could hold them, the coverage check refused the plan, and the card stayed
 * blank. Which is the outcome this whole change exists to end.
 *
 * A square that overhangs costs nothing and gives up nothing. The overhanging
 * pixels are filled by replicating the nearest real edge pixel and are marked
 * NOT editable in the mask, so the model is told to leave them alone; they are
 * never composited back, because `compositePatch` writes only inside the frame
 * and only where the mask allows. The picture the model sees is still made of

 * contain both squares is not performed, and the two stay separate requests.
