/**
 * Builder stock — asking OUR OWN worker to rebuild what a badge was covering.
 *
 * THE ONLY VISUAL INPUT IS THE BUILDER'S OWN FILE FOR THAT PROPERTY. Not a
 * reference photograph, not another facade, not a rendering of a house, not a
 * search result, not a stock image, not a second example of "what a roof looks
 * like". One image goes into each request — a square cut out of that property's
 * own primary image — with a mask marking the graphic to remove. There is no
 * conditioning image parameter anywhere in this file and there must never be
 * one.
 *
 * AND IT DOES NOT REGENERATE THE PICTURE. The worker's answer is used at the
 * mask and discarded everywhere else: `compositePatch` writes only where
 * `blendWeights` is non-zero, and `outsidePermittedRegionUnchanged` then checks
 * the whole frame against the bytes that came out of storage. A response that
 * came back re-lit, re-framed or with a different house on it changes nothing
 * outside the badge, because nothing outside the badge is ever read from it.
 *
 * THE WORKER IS PRIVATE AND OURS, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THIS FILE'S
 * SECOND LIFE. The first version of this transport posted each patch to
 * OpenAI's image-edit endpoint on a forwarded vendor key — a per-image bill
 * on somebody else's credit, and a whole production outage the day that
 * account ran dry (the settler's log still documents the 429s). The endpoint
 * is now `cloudflare/builder-stock-image-worker/`, a Cloudflare Worker THIS
 * repository ships, which runs the repair on Cloudflare Workers AI through
 * the account's own AI binding: no third-party generative API, no Docker and
 * no server of any kind, and there is no OpenAI URL, key or model name
 * anywhere in the Builder Stock path — a test reads this file's source and
 * fails if one comes back. This transport sends an image and a mask and
 * nothing else; the instruction the model needs is a pinned constant in the
 * worker's own reviewed source (a request carrying one is refused), so there
 * is no instruction string here for anyone to soften and no way to ask for a
 * nicer house than the one that was photographed.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MAY REFUSE, and every one of them is recorded rather than
 * swallowed: no worker configured, a worker that errors or times out, a
 * response that is not an image, an image that will not decode, a patch count
 * that says this is a marketing tile rather than a photograph, and a result
 * the gate rejects. In none of those cases does anything else become the
 * card's picture — and an unreachable worker is an OPERATIONAL fault the
 * settler retries, never a verdict about the photograph.
 *
 * The call still goes through `meteredFetch`, exactly as the WeasyPrint and
 * PDF-parse sidecars do: the service token is the workspace's own, so Mission
 * Control rates the usage at nothing, but the call is still visible in the
 * usage ledger instead of being untracked spend.
