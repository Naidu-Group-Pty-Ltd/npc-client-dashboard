/**
 * Builder stock — telling a property photograph from a marketing tile.
 *
 * THE CASE THIS EXISTS FOR. A builder publishes their listing image as a
 * 1200×600 tile with the property's own facade under a status ribbon: pills
 * reading "Completed" and "SMSF", one reading "$25,000 Rebate", suburb and
 * state banners. Those bytes are genuinely the builder's, they are genuinely
 * of that property, and the source genuinely designates them as its listing
 * image — every provenance question answers yes — and the picture is still not
 * one to put in front of a client being asked to buy a house.
 *
 * SO THIS ANSWERS A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM EVERY OTHER MODULE HERE. Not
 * "whose house is it" and not "did the builder supply it" — those are settled
 * structurally, before anything gets here, and nothing in this file may ever
 * be used to settle them. Only: has promotional treatment been laid OVER the
 * photograph.
 *
 * TWO INDEPENDENT SIGNALS, AND EITHER IS ENOUGH.
 *
 *   1  PROMINENT OVERLAY TYPOGRAPHY. Big lettering laid over the picture, in
 *      lines, whatever it says and whatever is behind it. This is the general
 *      signal and the one that survives a change of campaign: it does not care
 *      about colour, so a black, white, grey, gradient, semi-transparent or
 *      entirely absent backing plate makes no difference to it, and text set
 *      straight onto the photograph is caught the same way. Letters are found
 *      as shapes and never read — nothing here recognises a word, and there is
 *      no vocabulary to recognise one against.
 *
 *   2  A LARGE FLAT COLOURED BLOCK. A pill, a ribbon or a banner, found as a
 *      region of one exact colour with straight sides. Kept because it catches
 *      a graphic carrying no lettering at all, and because it is cheap.
 *
 * WHAT SEPARATES THEM FROM A PHOTOGRAPH, in both cases, is that neither
 * lettering nor a vector fill occurs naturally in one. A sky has a gradient, a
 * lawn has texture, a wall has shading, and a roofline is not a straight edge
 * of one colour. Where a sky IS flat and saturated — a render's often is — it
 * is still cut off by a roof, a tree, a fence, and the straightness of a
 * region's own sides is what tells the two apart.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS DISPLAYABLE, measured on the live source: a builder's own small
 * corner tag, an "ARTIST IMPRESSION. INDICATIVE ONLY." footer, a logo, a
 * watermark, a design name. Every one of them is small — that is the whole of
 * the distinction, and it is a measurement rather than a list.
 *
 * Pure: no imports, no IO, no clock.

 * over a bright sky differs from its neighbourhood by single-figure levels once
 * the picture has been encoded and scaled down, against a strict floor of
 * forty. The strict pass therefore found nothing, and "found nothing" was being
 * reported as "this picture is clean".
 *
 * LOWERING `INK_CONTRAST` IS NOT THE FIX. At 26 a clean render's own
 * architecture starts producing runs that pass every geometric test, and
 * refusing real photographs is worse than the defect being fixed.
 *
 * WHAT SEPARATES THE TWO IS THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, NOT THE MARK. A sky is smooth,
 * so anything drawn on it stands out however faint. A roofline sits among
 * gutters, eaves, window reveals and shadow, every one of them stronger than
 * the mark being tested. So the faint pass looks ONLY where the picture is
 * quiet, and inside those places it can afford to be very sensitive.
 *
 * WHAT IT PRODUCES IS NOT A REFUSAL. A run found only here is `uncertain`, not
 * `annotated`: the classifier is saying it cannot call this picture clean,
 * which hides it as `pending` rather than convicting it as a marketing tile.
 * Eligible has to mean measured-and-established-clean, and this is the whole
 * difference between that and "the strict detector happened to be silent".
