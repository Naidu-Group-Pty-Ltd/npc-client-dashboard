/**
 * Builder stock lists — retrieving a PUBLIC Notion page's actual content.
 *
 * A published Notion page serves a client-rendering shell. The stock list is
 * not in that HTML at any point: it is fetched afterwards, by the browser,
 * from Notion's own public endpoints on the same host, with no credential of
 * any kind. This module makes those same unauthenticated requests server-side
 * and hands the result to `notionRecordMap.pure.ts` to decode.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT:
 *   • It is NOT a Notion API integration. There is no key, no token, no OAuth,
 *     no setting, and nothing is read from the environment. The endpoints used
 *     are the ones a logged-out browser calls for a page that has been shared
 *     to the web; a page that has not been shared answers them with a 401,
 *     which is exactly the evidence `notion_not_public` is allowed to rest on.
 *   • It is NOT a second import pipeline. It produces a matrix. The matrix
 *     becomes CSV, the CSV goes through `runStockImport` like every other
 *     source, and nothing downstream knows Notion exists.
 *   • It executes NO JavaScript. It parses JSON.
 *
 * SSRF: every request goes through `postGuardedJson`, which applies the same
 * `assertPublicUrl` guard, the same timeouts and the same size ceiling as the
 * ordinary source fetch, refuses redirects outright, and sends no cookie,
 * Authorization header or Supabase credential. The destination is additionally
 * pinned to the SAME HOST the page was fetched from, and only when that host
 * is a Notion one — so this cannot be steered at a third address.
