/**
 * Builder stock — finding the STICKER, as opposed to finding a flat colour.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, AND IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE REPAIR. The
 * classifier's flat-colour pass answers "is there promotional treatment on this
 * picture", and for that purpose a false positive is cheap: the card shows
 * nothing. The repair asks a different question — "which pixels may I rebuild"
 * — and there a false positive is catastrophic, because rebuilding them
 * REMOVES WHATEVER WAS THERE.
 *
 * Lot 13 Hummock Rise is the proof. Its flat-colour regions, measured on the
 * real production bytes, are: the black garage door (7.5% of the frame), a
 * patch of pale sky (6.7%), and one of the two green status pills (4.5%). The
 * other pill is not a region at all. Repairing that mask took the garage door
 * off a house and left the marketing on it. I have the render; it is a house
 * with timber where its garage used to be.
 *
 * SO THE MASK IS DERIVED FROM THE TYPE, NOT FROM THE COLOUR. A promotional
 * badge is a plate WITH WORDS ON IT. The strict text pass already finds the
 * words, to thresholds fitted so no real photograph trips them; this takes each
 * of those runs, samples the colour immediately around it, and floods that
 * colour outward to find the plate the words sit on. A black garage door has no
 * words on it and is never reached. Neither is sky, a roof or a wall.
 *
 * AND THERE IS A SECOND KIND OF PLATE, WHICH COST FOUR CARDS TO FIND. A badge
 * does not always carry words this detector can read. Cloverton Registered
 * carries "Registered" in 60px type on a green pill, and the strict pass finds
 * ZERO runs on it at every resolution from 400px to full size — so a mask
 * derived from type alone is empty, the repair reports "nothing to remove", and
 * four production cards sat blank while the classifier went on refusing the
 * picture. The pill itself, meanwhile, is exactly the flat region the
 * classifier DID find.
 *
 * What separates that pill from Lot 13's black garage door is not words: it is
 * COLOUR. Measured on the production set, every promotional plate is a
 * chromatic fill — the green pills at 0.54-0.90 saturation, the red at 0.69,
 * Brownsplains' blue at 0.70, Coridale's at 0.70, none below 112 chroma — and
 * the architectural regions are neutral: Lot 537 Kirramingly's white garage
 * door measures 0.045 saturation and 10 chroma, and a black door measures less.
 * That is not a narrow margin to fit a threshold into, it is an order of
 * magnitude, and it has a physical reason: a photoreal render is made of
 * material colours, and a brand badge is a colour chosen so that it cannot be
 * mistaken for one.
 *
 * So a flat region whose fill is chromatic is a plate in its own right. A
 * neutral one never is, whatever its size or position — which is what keeps
 * every garage door, roof, wall, driveway and patch of sky out of the mask.
 *
 * AND IT REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES. A run whose surroundings are not one
 * colour has no plate — it is type set straight onto the photograph, and there
 * is no honest extent to remove — so it contributes nothing and the picture
 * keeps its blank card. A flood that runs away into the photograph is refused
 * on the same principle: a plate is small, and something that isn't is not a
 * plate.
 *
 * Pure: no imports, no IO, no clock.
