/**
 * "We started reading that package and never came back."
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `recoverPackageImage` downloads a multi-megabyte PDF,
 * extracts its rasters and classifies them, and once begun nothing stops it.
 * When the edge worker kills the invocation partway through — `CPU Time
 * exceeded`, `Memory limit exceeded` — there is no throw to catch, no `finally`
 * that runs and no response to inspect. The process simply ends.
 *
 * Every guard the repair already has is blind to that. `MAX_ITEMS_RESTORED_PER_RUN`
 * and `MAX_PACKAGE_RECOVERIES_PER_RUN` are counters that reset with the run.
 * `PACKAGE_RECOVERY_RESERVE_MS` reserves WALL CLOCK, and the binding limit here
 * is CPU and memory. The `try/catch` around the recovery cannot catch a kill.
 * So the next tick reads the same queue, reaches the same property, starts the
 * same download and dies at the same place — for ever.
 *
 * PRODUCTION, 28 AUGUST 2026. Upload `eccc9840` settled twelve properties and
 * then stopped dead on the thirteenth, Lot 104 Finch Road. Every tick from
 * 02:00 onward booted, ran six to nine seconds and was killed, alternating
 * `CPU Time exceeded` and `Memory limit exceeded`, emitting no tick log at all.
 * `source_images_settled_version` stayed NULL, so the upload never settled, so
 * the fallback ladder was never entered, so three properties stayed blank on
 * the live Marketplace. One heavy package held twenty-three properties still.
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS TO WRITE SOMETHING DOWN BEFORE THE DANGEROUS STEP, which is
 * the same shape as the repair claim the sanitizer already uses: a
 * compare-and-set before the spend, so that being killed is survivable
 * evidence rather than silence. An attempt is recorded, the step runs, and a
 * verdict overwrites the attempt. A kill leaves the attempt standing, and the
 * next tick can SEE it.
 *
 * IT SHARES `source_provenance_result` WITH THE VERDICT, AND THAT IS SAFE BY
 * CONSTRUCTION. `negativeProvenanceStillStands` returns false for any record
 * whose `result` is not `no_deterministic_image`, so an attempt record reads as
 * "no answer yet — ask again". That is the fail-open direction that module
 * chose deliberately, and this leans on it rather than modifying it: no new
 * column, no new table, no change to what a verdict means.

/**
 * How many times a branch may answer `unreachable` before it is retired.

 * WHY THIS HAS TO EXIST AT ALL. `unreachable` records nothing, deliberately:
 * a sign-in wall may open tomorrow and banking "no image" for it would suppress
 * a document that reads perfectly well. But `openBranches` then returns the
 * branch again on the next tick, for ever — and a property whose every
 * remaining branch is unreachable never leaves the source stage, so it never
 * reaches the fallback ladder that would have given it a picture.
 *
 * PRODUCTION, 31 AUGUST 2026, upload `43ffa452`. Thirteen properties were
 * claimed every sixty seconds, indefinitely, on branches that can never
 * answer: two Drive files returning 404 (deleted, or their permission
 * revoked), one answering `Google Drive: Sign-in`, and single-page siting
 * plans with no text layer for the reader to read. Rotation gave each of them
 * its turn and each turn answered the same nothing.
 *
 * SIX, not two. An unreachable answer costs one cheap fetch rather than a
 * killed worker, and the failures it covers include genuinely transient ones —
 * a slow origin, a rate limit, a cold cache — so it is worth several more
 * goes. What it must not be is unbounded, because "we keep trying" is not the
 * alternative to retiring: the alternative is a property pinned on the source
 * stage with no picture at all.
 *
 * And retiring is not for ever. The question is keyed on the provenance
 * version, the package and the anchor, so a bumped extractor or a re-imported
 * row asks again from zero — which is exactly the asymmetry
 * `recordPackageUnprocessable` already embodies for the kill case.
