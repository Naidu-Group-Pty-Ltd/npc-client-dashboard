/**
 * Builder stock — the order the two repairs are tried in, and the proof.
 *
 * ONE ENTRY POINT, taking the builder's bytes and returning either a cleaned
 * copy of them or a refusal. Ingestion calls it as an image is stored and the
 * settler calls it for everything stored before it existed, so a picture
 * imported tomorrow and a picture imported last year get the identical
 * treatment from the identical code.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS DETERMINISTIC FIRST, ALWAYS.
 *
 *   clean            the detector found no laid-over graphic → NOTHING IS DONE.
 *                    The builder's file is served exactly as supplied. A repair
 *                    that runs on a picture nobody objected to is a change to a
 *                    photograph for no reason.
 *
 *   small and quiet  `sanitizeOverlay` — arithmetic, no model, no network, the
 *                    same bytes out every time. This is the preferred answer
 *                    and it is tried first even when the generative route is
 *                    available, because a reconstruction nobody has to trust
 *                    beats one somebody does.
 *
 *   large or busy    only then, `inpaintOverlay` — the same mask, the same
 *                    original, a model rebuilding what was behind it, and the
 *                    result composited at the mask alone.
 *
 * AND THE ANSWER IS CHECKED BEFORE IT IS OFFERED. Whatever produced it, the
 * result goes back through the SAME classifier that refused the original. A
 * repair that leaves the graphic legible measures as annotated a second time
 * and is refused here — recorded as work done, never served. That is the only
 * honest way to claim the marketing is gone: not that a repair ran, but that
 * the thing which objected no longer objects.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE CAN SUBSTITUTE AN IMAGE. Every path returns either a derivative
 * of these exact bytes or a refusal. There is no branch that reaches another
 * image, another property, a search, a map, a render or a generator, and the
 * refusal deliberately carries no candidate for a caller to fall back to.
