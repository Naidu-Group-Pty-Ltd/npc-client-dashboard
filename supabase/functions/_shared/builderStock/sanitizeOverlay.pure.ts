/**
 * Builder stock — taking the marketing sticker off the builder's own photograph.
 *
 * THE PICTURE IS THE BUILDER'S AND STAYS THE BUILDER'S. This removes a graphic
 * that was laid ON TOP of a photograph and rebuilds only what that graphic was
 * covering. It is not a generator: nothing here invents a house, and there is
 * no model, no network call and no randomness anywhere in it. The same bytes in
 * produce the same bytes out, on any runtime, for ever.
 *
 * HOW THE HOLE IS FILLED. The overlay's own pixels are discarded and replaced
 * by solving Laplace's equation across the hole with the surrounding
 * photograph as the boundary condition — the smoothest surface that meets the
 * real pixels at every edge of the patch. On sky, render gradients, grass and
 * roof sheeting, which is where builders put these badges, that reconstruction
 * is what was behind them to within a shade. It is seeded by pushing the
 * nearest real pixel inward first so the relaxation starts from something
 * plausible rather than from grey, which is what stops a large patch settling
 * into a visible flat blob.
 *
 * AND IT REFUSES WHEN IT WOULD BE GUESSING. Diffusion reconstructs a smooth
 * field, so it is right exactly when the covered area was smooth and wrong when
 * the badge sat across a window, a roofline or a tree. `boundaryDetail`
 * measures how busy the real pixels immediately around the hole are, and a
 * patch whose surroundings are structured is REFUSED rather than smeared:
 * a plausible-looking wrong facade is worse than no photograph, because nobody
 * can tell it happened. That refusal is reported, never silently swallowed.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO. It does not crop, it does not scale, it does not
 * recolour, it does not touch a pixel outside the mask, and it does not run at
 * all on a picture the detector called clean. Everything outside the removed
 * graphic is the builder's original pixel, unchanged, and a test asserts that
 * byte for byte.
 */



/**
 * How far the mask is grown before filling.
 *
 * A badge is composited with soft edges, so the pixels just outside the
 * detector's region are a blend of graphic and photograph. Leaving them behind
 * draws a ghost outline exactly where the badge was — the one artefact that
 * makes a repair obvious. Three pixels covers the anti-aliasing on the sizes
 * builders actually publish without eating into the picture.

 *
 * WHAT THE DETAIL TEST MISSES. Laplace's equation interpolates between the
 * boundary values, so a hole whose ring is all one colour fills invisibly and a
 * hole with two very different colours on opposite sides fills with a RAMP
 * between them — a visible streak, exactly the shape of the hole. Both rings
 * can be locally smooth, so the neighbour-difference test says nothing about
 * it: measured on the real bytes, Lot 13 Hummock Rise scores 2.46 and the
 * Brownsplains badge scores 3.18, and Lot 13 is the one that came out as two
 * grey smears while Brownsplains is indistinguishable from an unbadged render.
 *
 * On THIS measure they are 41.8 and 22.0. Lot 13's badges lie across sky on one
 * side and dark timber cladding on the other; the Brownsplains badge lies on
 * open sky. Thirty sits in the middle of a gap that is nearly twice as wide as

 * the TOTAL, on the evidence that Lot 13 Hummock Rise "covers 23% of the frame
 * between its badges" — but that 23% was measured against a mask which has
 * since been shown to be wrong, one that included the house's black garage door
 * and a patch of sky. Its two actual badges are 6.2% each. Two small holes at
 * opposite ends of a photograph are two small reconstructions; summing them
 * describes nothing about either.
 *
 * Fitted against the real covers: the Brownsplains badge (7.6% of the frame,
 * detail 2.9, sitting on open sky) is removed so completely that the result is
 * indistinguishable from an unbadged render, while the Cloverton "Registered"
 * pill (2.8% but detail 11.2, sitting over a tree) is refused for the detail
