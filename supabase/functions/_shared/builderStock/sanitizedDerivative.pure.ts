/**
 * Builder stock — the record of a cleaned copy, and the rules for serving it.
 *
 * A sanitized derivative is a SECOND set of bytes made from ONE set of bytes:
 * the builder's own primary image for that exact property, with a graphic that
 * was laid over it removed. It is not a replacement and it is not an
 * alternative image. Nothing else is ever an input, and this module exists so
 * that claim is checkable rather than merely intended — every record names the
 * exact original by id and by SHA-256, and a derivative whose provenance does
 * not tie back to the bytes currently in the row is not served.
 *
 * IT IS STORED BESIDE THE ORIGINAL VERDICT, NEVER OVER IT. The original stays
 * `ineligible / annotated_marketing_tile`, because that is the truth about the
 * builder's file and overwriting it would erase the reason the derivative
 * exists. What changes is one extra fact — this record — and the display rule
 * reads both: a card may draw the original when it is eligible, or the frozen
 * derivative when one has been made and passed. Nothing else, ever.
 *
 * A FAILURE IS RECORDED TOO, AND IT IS NOT A DERIVATIVE. Where a repair was
 * attempted and refused — by the deterministic gates, by the validation gate,
 * or by the endpoint — that is written as a failure, under its own key, and the
 * card goes on showing nothing. No other image takes its place. The failure is
 * terminal for the version that produced it for exactly the reason the
 * eligibility verdict is: retrying identical work every five minutes for ever
 * is what the settlement programme spent a fortnight undoing.
 *
 * Pure: no imports, no IO, no clock.
 */

/**
 * Bumped when a repair would come out differently for bytes already handled.
 *
 * ONE NUMBER FOR THE WHOLE STAGE, covering both routes. A record names which
 * route made it, but "is this record stale" is one question and must have one
 * answer: two counters would let a deterministic derivative be current while a
 * generative one from the same run was not, and nothing downstream could say
 * which of the two a card was showing.
 *
 * Deliberately not `MARKETPLACE_ELIGIBILITY_VERSION` and deliberately not
 * `PROVENANCE_VERSION`. Whether a picture may be drawn, where its bytes came
 * from, and how well a graphic can be taken off it are three questions that

 *      promotional treatment at all is CLEARED rather than left blank

 *
 * SERVING AND SCHEDULING ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, AND THIS ANSWERS ONLY THE
 * FIRST. It used to refuse any record below `SANITIZATION_VERSION`, on the

 * was removed, and the result was measured. A better inspection arriving later
 * does not make that false. So the version governs `sanitizationSettled` — is
 * this row due another look — and nothing here. The two questions were
 * conflated because one number answered both, and one of the answers was wrong.

 * Fails closed in every other direction. The cost of refusing wrongly is a
