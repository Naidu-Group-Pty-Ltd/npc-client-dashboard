/**
 * Builder stock — the FALLBACK ladder, driven by the background sweep rather
 * than by somebody's browser.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG. The fallback ladder already existed and was already correct:
 * `enrichStockItem` runs stage B (a web photograph verified against the exact
 * property) and then stage C (Street View bound to the address), and
 * `nextImageStage` decides which. It had exactly ONE caller in production —
 * `builder-portal-stock`'s `enrich_images` loop, which only runs while a
 * builder has the page open. The autonomous settler drove provenance,
 * eligibility, sanitization and primary enforcement, and never once called it.
 *
 * So an import finished its builder-source recovery, the settler's queue went
 * empty, the tick answered `complete: true`, pg_cron unscheduled itself — and
 * a property whose builder supplied no usable photograph sat blank for ever,
 * because the only thing that would have looked elsewhere was a browser that
 * had been closed hours earlier. Production, 28 August 2026: three properties
 * with a terminal `no_deterministic_image`, zero image rows of any kind, all
 * 23 items still `enrichment_status = 'pending'` with `enriched_at` null. The
 * ladder had never run for a single one of them.
 *
 * THIS MODULE IS ORCHESTRATION AND NOTHING ELSE. It does not decide which
 * stage a property is owed, does not verify a web result's identity, does not
 * call Street View, does not rank an image and does not pick a primary. Every
 * one of those is `enrichStockItem`'s, imported rather than restated — a
 * second copy of the ladder is how the two would come to disagree about which
 * house is on somebody's card.
 */
// TYPE-ONLY, and the implementation is imported lazily below. `images.ts`
// reaches for the edge runtime through its provider modules, so importing it
// eagerly would make this module — and the settler's whole completion rule —
// unloadable anywhere but Deno. The same reason `repairSourceImages.ts`
// defers `fetchSource.ts`.

 * headroom — and each of those returned no body, no CORS header and no marker.
 * A fallback item is a Perplexity search, a geocode, a Street View metadata
 * call and a Street View still, each on a forwarded vendor credential.
 *
 * Correctness does not depend on speed here, because the cron is resumable and
 * every item's outcome is durable: one per tick drains any queue eventually,

 * its identity check writes a terminal `failed` and leaves the
