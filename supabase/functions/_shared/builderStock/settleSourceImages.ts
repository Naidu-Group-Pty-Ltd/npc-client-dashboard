/**
 * Builder stock — bringing an upload's imagery up to the CURRENT rules, once.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `repairSourceImagesForUpload` has always been able to read a
 * source again and attach exactly the right picture. What it never had was
 * anything that ran it. It sat behind a "Source images" button in the Builder
 * Portal, so a stock list whose images were written under older rules kept
 * showing an empty frame until a person went and pressed it — and a person who
 * has just uploaded a stock list has no reason to think they should.
 *
 * So the repair becomes a STEP with a terminal marker rather than a command:
 *
 *   An upload is SETTLED at provenance version N when its imagery has been
 *   re-derived under the rules of version N. `source_images_settled_version`
 *   records it. An upload below the current version has work outstanding; an
 *   upload at it has none, however few images it ended up with.
 *
 * THE MARKER IS WHAT MAKES IT SAFE TO RUN AUTOMATICALLY. Without it the only
 * available test is "does this upload have properties with no picture", which is
 * true for ever of a spreadsheet that carries no imagery — so every pass would
 * re-read every source, and a loop driving it would never converge. With it,
 * each upload is re-read once per rules change and then left alone.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS AN IMPORT. No stock item is created, no property field is
 * written, no price, availability, selection or linkage is touched. The only
 * writes are `builder_stock_item_images` rows, the `primary_image_id` those
 * rows earn, and this marker.
