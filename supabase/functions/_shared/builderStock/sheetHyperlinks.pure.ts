/**
 * BUILDER STOCK — A SPREADSHEET CELL CAN SAY "Brochure" AND MEAN A URL.
 *
 * A stock list kept in Google Sheets carries its documents as HYPERLINKS: the
 * cell displays a label — `Brochure`, `Masterplan`, `Stage 6 - POS` — and the
 * address lives underneath it. Every CSV export, Google's own included, writes
 * the displayed value and throws the target away. Measured on a real builder
 * list: five link-bearing columns, 119 rows, and ZERO plain-text URLs anywhere
 * in the tab. Read as CSV alone, not one property has a builder source for
 * stage 1 to follow, and the whole ladder starts at its second rung.
 *
 * XLSX keeps them. SheetJS surfaces one as `cell.l.Target` beside the
 * displayed `cell.v`, and a labelled cell with no link — `N/A` — carries none,
 * so the two are distinguishable rather than inferred.
 *
 *
 * MEMBERSHIP DOES NOT MOVE. THIS ONLY ADDS COLUMNS.
 *
 * The exact requested gid remains the only thing that says which properties
 * exist: its CSV supplies the rows, their order and their values, and this
 * appends a URL column beside each link-bearing one. No row is added, removed
 * or reordered — asserted here rather than promised, because a workbook export
 * is the WHOLE workbook and letting it near membership is how another tab's
 * rows become a builder's stock.
 *
 * WHICH WORKSHEET, THOUGH. An XLSX export contains every tab and nothing in it
 * records the gid, so the worksheet has to be identified by what it CONTAINS.
 * Position is not identity: the requested tab is routinely not the first, and
 * a workbook's sheet order is not the order the tabs were created in. So each
 * worksheet is scored against the proven CSV and exactly one must win
 * decisively. Zero matches means the links are unavailable and the import
 * proceeds on the CSV alone; an ambiguous match means the same, because
 * borrowing a near-identical tab's links is precisely the failure this exists
 * to prevent.
 *
 * Pure: no IO, no clock, no network.
