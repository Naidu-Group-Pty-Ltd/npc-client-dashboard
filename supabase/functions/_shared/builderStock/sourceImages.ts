/**
 * Builder stock — bringing the builder's OWN image inside.
 *
 * Stage 1 of the three-stage enrichment, and the only stage that can say
 * "this is the photograph the builder supplied for this property". Everything
 * here exists to keep that sentence true after the source has moved on:
 *
 *   THE BYTES ARE COPIED, THE LINK IS NOT KEPT. A Notion attachment resolves
 *   to a signed URL that expires within the hour, and a builder's own site
 *   reorganises. A marketplace card that depends on either shows a broken
 *   image to a client weeks later, so the bytes are fetched once, at import,
 *   and stored in the private `builder-stock-images` bucket. What is recorded
 *   against the row is the SOURCE's own identity — `attachment:<id>:<name>`,
 *   the page URL — never the temporary URL we happened to fetch through.
 *
 *   THE BYTES ARE CHECKED, NOT THE PROMISE. A content type is a claim by
 *   whoever served the file. `validateSourceImageBytes` reads the signature,
 *   which is why an HTML login wall served as `image/jpeg` is refused rather
 *   than stored and shown to a client.
 *
 * SSRF: every retrieval goes through `fetchStockSource` — the existing guard,
 * applied to the original URL and to every redirect hop, with no cookie, no
 * Authorization header, no Supabase credential and no builder session
 * attached. Notion's public image endpoint redirects to its CDN, which is
 * exactly why the guard has to run per hop rather than once.

/**
 * Bumped when what we record about an image's origin changes.
 *
 * A row written before provenance was recorded cannot prove where its picture
 * came from, so the repair re-derives it rather than trusting the label.
 *
 * 3 adds the IMAGE ROLE. Versions 1 and 2 proved where the bytes came from and
 * said nothing about what the source presented them as, which is how a bedroom
 * render came to be a property's card image. Every version-2 row is therefore
 * unproven for display purposes and is re-derived rather than trusted — which
 * is the behaviour this constant already had, applied to a second fact.
 *
 * 4 changes the REFERENCE, which is what a row is KEYED on. A page's resource
 * name is not unique across the forms that draw it, so `page3:Im0` could be two
 * different pictures and the second silently replaced the first; references now
 * carry the object number. A version-3 row keyed the old way can never match
 * the new one, and the re-audit is deliberately forbidden from demoting a row
 * already at the current version — so it would sit there ready and displayable
 * for ever beside its replacement. Bumping is what retires it.
 *
 * 5 changes what the package reader can IDENTIFY, and every negative version 4
 * banked is therefore stale by definition. Two capabilities changed. A page now
 * states a property's identity when it names the lot, contradicts no other lot
 * and names the design — rather than when it repeats every one of the label's
 * first eight tokens, which required the builder's document to word an address
 * exactly as the stock list does and refused twenty-five live properties whose
 * own package cover names them plainly. And a document whose pages carry no
 * extractable text is now operationally unreadable rather than a finished "this
 * names no image", because a reader that read nothing has learned nothing.
 *
 * 6 changes what the package reader can IDENTIFY again, in the one way that
 * mattered most. A property's cover page was resolved as "exactly one
 * qualifying page or no image", and a builder package is a cover page AND a
 * floor plan, both repeating the lot header and the price strip — so both
 * qualified and the whole document was refused. Measured on the live stock
 * list the morning this was found: 281 documents opened, 20 images taken, 94
 * properties holding 28 photographs. `resolvePropertyCover` now reads the page
 * stating the MOST of the package as the cover, which recovered five of ten
 * sampled brochures with every recovered image inspected and correct.
 *
 * Every negative banked at 5 was therefore decided by a reader that could not
 * see a two-page package at all, and is stale by definition.
 *
 * 7 changes which HOSTS the package reader can open at all. Every link that
 * was not Google Drive was refused at the front door — "That package is not
 * on a source we can read" — before anything was fetched, and the refusal was
 * banked as a finished `no_deterministic_image`. On the live stock list that
 * was every one of its thirteen brochures: Dropbox shared links, each serving
 * the actual PDF (measured: 5–8 MB, `%PDF-`) once asked for the FILE rather
 * than the viewer via the `dl=1` parameter Dropbox itself publishes. A direct
 * document link on an ordinary host now goes through the same guarded fetch
 * and the same cover-identification path a Drive direct link does. Every
 * negative banked at 6 for a non-Drive branch was therefore decided by a
 * reader that never fetched anything, and is stale by definition.
 *
 * 8 changes what a negative MEANS, and what the reader can get out of a heavy
 * document. Two capabilities moved at once.
 *
 * A negative now says WHY it is negative. `no_deterministic_image` was written
 * by three different things — a document we read that names nothing, a package
 * that destroyed the worker twice, and a link that answered six times with
 * nothing readable — and only the first is knowledge about the property. Every
 * record banked at 7 or below is unclassified, so it cannot be trusted to
 * admit or withhold the online fallback and is stale by definition. See
 * `EvidenceExhaustion` and `suppliedEvidence.pure.ts`.
 *
 * And a heavy document is no longer decoded page by page before anything is
 * decided. Rasters are materialised for the pages the TEXT already implicates
 * — see `discoverPdfSourceAssets` — which is what a 13.2 MB, 23-page brochure
 * of 5334x3334 JPEGs needs in order to be read inside an edge worker at all.
 * Both live examples sat at `attempts: 2`, one tick from being retired.
 *
 * 9 changes what the reader can SEE and what it can AFFORD. Two capabilities.
 *
 * A locked-export Google Sheet's links are now read at all: a document whose
 * owner disabled download answers 401 to every `export?format=…` while
 * serving its rows, and its link targets are recovered from the one public
 * representation that carries them (`htmlview/sheet` — see
 * `googleSheetsHtmlGrid.pure.ts`), merged by the same content-proven
 * alignment as ever. And a heavy document no longer costs a full-buffer scan
 * PER PAGE: the object index is memoised (see `scanPdfObjects`), which took
 * the live 13.9 MB Mandalay brochure from ~5.9 s of parser CPU — a worker
 * kill on every attempt, retired operationally at 8 — to ~0.5 s. Every
 * operational retirement banked at 8 was decided under that cost and is
 * stale by definition.
 *
 * 10 widens what a cover page may CORROBORATE ITSELF with. The cover rule's
 * fourth test accepted only tokens of the row's display label, and that label
 * shows the suburb and hides the estate whenever a lot is present — while a
 * builder's own cover identifies a lot the way the estate's marketing does.
 * Measured live, 2 September 2026: the Watsons Reach brochure for lot 102
 * states "Lot 102 Watsons Reach Estate" beside its package price and was
 * refused for not saying "Diggers Rest". The row's own identity names —
 * `development_name`, `project_name` — now travel as hints for that one test
 * (see `stockIdentityHints` and `pageStatesIdentity`), so every
 * `not_identified` banked at 9 was judged under the narrower rule and is
 * stale by definition.
 *
 * 11 reads a lot number the way the PAGE typesets it. The same list's lot 103
 * brochure extracts its identity line as "2 1 Lot 10 3 Watsons Reach Estate"
 * — the exporter split the digits into runs — so the strict token reading saw
 * "Lot 10", failed the our-lot test and counted a foreign lot, and the
 * builder's own document was refused. A run of digit tokens after Lot/Unit is
 * now read fused as well as strictly (see `lotDesignationReadings`), so a
 * `not_identified` banked at 10 was judged under the split-blind reading and
 * is stale by definition.
 *
 * 12 reads the LIVE generation of an incrementally updated document. The
 * compressed-object recovery kept the FIRST copy of each object number, and
 * an incremental update appends revisions after the ones they replace — so
 * on the same lot 102 brochure (five generations, twenty-one object streams)
 * the walker served the STALE page dictionary, whose image map pointed at
 * the template's sample artwork (another design's floor plan, labelled
 * LOT 414) while the newest generation mapped the builder's real 1920x1080
 * facade render. Recovery is last-generation-wins now, agreeing with the raw
 * byte scan (see `recoverCompressedObjects`), so every negative banked at 11
 * against such a document was judged on the wrong generation's pictures and
 * is stale by definition.
 *
 * 13 lets a COVER STATE ITS HERO BY SIZE. `selectCoverHero` refused every
 * page presenting more than one unrepeated photograph, on the reasoning that
 * a page presenting a choice has not said which picture is the property's.
 * That is right where ownership is the question, and wrong where the page has
 * already answered by how it drew them. Measured, 3 September 2026, on a
 * builder's own single-property brochure uploaded as a stock list (LOT 1731,
 * Austin Estate, Lara): both photographs on page 1 were found, attributed and
 * stored — the facade render covering 47.5% of the page and the only other
 * 14.2% — and the property was told its own brochure presents no cover image.
 * A photograph the cover draws at least twice the page of any other is now
 * taken as the hero, in the document's own terms and with the geometry named
 * in the reason; comparable sizes still answer no image. Every negative
 * banked at 12 against such a document was judged before the page's own
 * emphasis was read.
 *
 * This is the bump doing precisely the job it exists for: `negativeProvenance`
 * compares the stored version against this one, so raising it reopens every
 * banked negative for a reader that can now find what the old one could not.
