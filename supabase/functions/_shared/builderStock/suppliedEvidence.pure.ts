/**
 * BUILDER STOCK — "HAVE WE FINISHED LOOKING AT WHAT THE BUILDER SUPPLIED?"
 *
 * ONE AUTHORITATIVE ANSWER, ASKED BEFORE THE ONLINE FALLBACK MAY SPEND
 * ANYTHING. The stock list is the source of truth: the builder has usually
 * already handed the marketing material over, as a hyperlink behind the word
 * `Brochure`, as a Dropbox package, as a Drive folder, as a direct image. The
 * external search ladder exists for the rows where they genuinely have not,
 * and it may only run once that is a FACT rather than a guess.
 *
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG, AND WHY IT WAS INVISIBLE.
 *
 * The gate used to be the STAGE ORDER alone — `source` runs before `fallback`,
 * therefore source is finished. That is a statement about the scheduler, not
 * about the evidence. `settleClaimedItem` advanced a property the moment its
 * source run RETURNED, whatever the run had actually learned, so a property
 * whose brochure had never been opened reached the ladder exactly like one
 * whose brochure had been read cover to cover.
 *
 * Underneath it, a second and worse collapse: this repository has exactly one
 * negative result, `no_deterministic_image`, and THREE different things wrote
 * it.
 *
 *   1  We opened the document, read it, and it names no image for this
 *      property. That is knowledge.
 *
 *   2  This package destroyed the worker twice — `CPU Time exceeded`,
 *      `Memory limit exceeded` — so it was retired. See
 *      `recordPackageUnprocessable`.
 *
 *   3  This link answered six times with nothing we could read — a 404, a
 *      sign-in wall, a scan with no text layer. See
 *      `recordPackageUnreachable`.
 *
 * Only the first is a fact about the property. The other two are facts about
 * US, and both were being recorded in the same word — so a builder's brochure
 * that was too big to open read, downstream, as a builder who supplied
 * nothing, and the ladder went looking for the house on the open internet.
 *
 * MEASURED, 2 SEPTEMBER 2026, the live Luxton list. Lot 516 (10.6 MB) and Lot
 * 6706 (13.2 MB) both sat at `attempts: 2` — one tick from being retired as
 * "no image" — while their brochures state the lot, the street, the price and
 * the land size in AcroForm fields, and both extract in under 400 ms once the
 * decode is scoped. Lot 818's brochure had been refused before it was ever
 * fetched (the old Drive-only front door), the ladder ran, and the card was
 * given a render from a page titled `lot-118-by-simonds-homes` — a different
 * lot, by a different builder.
 *
 *
 * THE RULE: TIMEOUT IS NOT EXHAUSTION.
 *
 * A worker kill, an HTTP 5xx, a rate limit, a redirect that never resolved, a
 * database read that failed — none of them is "we looked and there was
 * nothing". They are `retryable_failure`, the ladder stays shut, and the card
 * stays BLANK with a reason an engineer can read. A correct blank beats a
 * plausible photograph of somebody else's house, and that asymmetry is the
 * whole posture of this subsystem.
 *
 * WHAT STOPS IT PINNING A PROPERTY FOR EVER is not this module — it is the
 * attempt budgets that run before retirement (`MAX_PACKAGE_ATTEMPTS`,
 * `MAX_UNREACHABLE_ATTEMPTS`) and the provenance VERSION, which is keyed into
 * every branch record. A reader that grows a new capability ships a version
 * bump, every operational retirement at the old version stops standing, and
 * the question is asked again from zero. That is the designed way out, and it
 * is the only one: nothing here may be repaired by editing a row.
 *
 * Pure: no IO, no clock, no network.

 * used to mean `no_evidence` — the builder supplied nothing, run the ladder.
 * But there is a second way a row ends up with no URLs: the SPREADSHEET
 * carries them and we could not get them out. The live VG master list is the
 * measured case — every `export?format=…` answers 401, `gviz` serves values
 * only, and before the htmlview reader existed all fifty-six of its document
 * links vanished at the door. Every one of its fourteen properties then read
 * as a builder who supplied nothing, and the external ladder was bought
 * against a stock list whose brochures were sitting in plain sight.
 *
 * OUR FAILURE IS NOT NO EVIDENCE. So the import now writes down, per row,
 * whether the row's link layer was actually enumerable — and a row whose
 * links could not be enumerated can never read as `exhausted` or
 * `no_evidence`, however empty it looks. It reads `retryable_failure`: the
 * ladder stays shut, the card stays blank, and the way in is fixing our
 * reader (a new import stamps the rows afresh) rather than papering the card
 * with somebody else's photograph.
 *
 * A ROW WITH NO STAMP IS A ROW WRITTEN BEFORE THE STAMP EXISTED — or by an
 * adapter whose links are native to its own bytes (an uploaded workbook, a
 * literal CSV, a PDF, a Notion record map, all of which carry their links IN
 * the parsed content). Those rows keep the reading they always had.
