/**
 * Project a normalised `ClientDetails` payload into the binding vocabulary a
 * Client Details template uses.
 *
 * ## It restates, and normalises nothing
 *
 * Like the Property Comparison before it, this format already has a normaliser
 * — `_shared/reports/clientDetails/normalise.pure.ts`, feeding
 * `render-client-details-pdf`. Every hard question about this record is
 * answered there once: which of nine tables a figure comes from, that stored
 * aggregates are never read, that frequencies are converted through one
 * function, that council and water rates are annual despite their `monthly_`
 * prefix, and that no emoji reaches a page whose faces have no coverage for it.
 *
 * So this takes the payload and restates it. One reader, two renderers, one
 * answer. `docs/reports/CLIENT_DETAILS.md` is that reader's contract.
 *
 * ## 96% of client records are empty, and the pages are built for that
 *
 * Measured across all 775 clients: **742 have no property, no employment, no
 * asset, no liability and no expense.** Not "few" — 96%. The legacy generator
 * opens on a Properties Overview and follows it with per-property blocks, which
 * for 742 clients is a cover and several pages of empty tables.
 *
 * `hasFinancials` is therefore published as a first-class fact, and the masters
 * make every financial page conditional on it. What a client with nothing
 * recorded gets is a short, finished document that says so — which is the most
 * useful thing this format can put in front of an adviser about to send a
 * record to a broker.
 *
 * ## The row counts are bounded here rather than on the page
 *
 * The family templates are absolutely positioned and cannot paginate — a table
 * that runs long does not spill onto the next page, it prints over whatever
 * follows. So every collection is capped, and every cap is measured:
 *
 * | Collection | Max in the record | Drawn | Clients above the cap |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | Expenses (rows) | **100** | — | grouped, never listed |
 * | Expenses (categories) | 14 | 14 | 0 |
 * | Assets | 18 | 8 | 2 of 20 |
 * | Liabilities | 16 | 8 | 1 of 18 |
 * | Properties | 4 | 4 | 0 |
 * | Employment | 3 | 3 | 0 |
 * | Address history | 18 | 4 | 2 of 18 |
 *
 * **Expenses are grouped, not truncated.** One client records 100 expense rows
 * and the average among the 13 who record any is 39 — no cap short enough to
 * fit a page would leave a useful document. Grouped by category the same client
 * is 14 rows, and a category total is what a broker reads anyway. The counts
 * are published beside the groups so the page can say what it did.
 *
 * Where a cap does bite, `…Count` is published beside `…Shown`, so the page can
 * say so rather than truncating in silence. That is `PORTFOLIO.md`'s F4: the
 * finding against the shipping generator is not that it stops, it is that it
 * stops "with nothing on the page saying so".
 *
 * ## Every `Measure` is unwrapped
 *
 * The payload carries `{ value, unit, precision }` so its own renderer can
 * format a figure with its unit. A template binds a raw number and applies
 * `| currency` or `| percent` itself, so `value` is published and the unit is
 * carried by the column heading. Publishing the object would render
 * `[object Object]` on a client's page.
