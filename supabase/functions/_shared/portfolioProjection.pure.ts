/**
 * Project a stored `portfolio_analysis_reports` row into the binding vocabulary
 * a Portfolio Performance Review template uses.
 *
 * ## Read from the table, not from a summary of it
 *
 * Every shape below was read off the live table across all 21 stored reports.
 * The prose in particular is not what its names suggest:
 * `analysis.executiveSummary` is an **object**, not a paragraph, and
 * `strategicRecommendations` is an object of four horizon buckets rather than a
 * list. Binding either as a string would have printed `[object Object]` on a
 * client's page — the modern equivalent of the "plausible-looking wrong output"
 * `docs/reports/BORROWING_CAPACITY.md` records.
 *
 *  - `portfolioMetrics` — totalValue, totalEquity, totalDebt, totalProperties,
 *    investmentCount, ownerOccupiedCount, rentalCount, averageLVR,
 *    averageYield, netMonthlyCashflow, totalMonthlyRentalIncome,
 *    totalMonthlyExpenses, personalExpenses, bestPerformer, worstPerformer.
 *  - `propertyAnalyses` — an **array** of per-property objects: address, value,
 *    loan, equity, lvr, grossYield, netMonthlyCashflow, annualCashflow,
 *    cashOnCashReturn, propertyType, lenderName, interestRate,
 *    ownershipPercentage, portfolioContribution, isOwnerOccupied.
 *
 *    Two things about that array are only visible from the data. **`lvr` and
 *    `grossYield` are numeric strings** — `"83.7"`, `"6.74"` — on all 66
 *    elements, so they are coerced rather than read; a projection that took
 *    them as numbers would publish nothing and blank two columns of the
 *    inventory. And **11 of the 66 have `netMonthlyCashflow`, `annualCashflow`
 *    and `monthlyRentalIncome` all JSON null** (owner-occupied holdings with no
 *    rental data). Those stay absent. `$0` a month is a claim, and it is the
 *    wrong one.
 *  - `analysis.executiveSummary` — `{ healthScore, overallHealth, keyStrengths,
 *    keyConcerns, primaryRecommendation }`, where the two `key*` fields are
 *    arrays of strings and `primaryRecommendation` is a string.
 *  - `analysis.financialHealth` — `{ analysis, cashflowStatus,
 *    debtServiceability, equityPosition, lvrRisk }`, all strings.
 *  - `analysis.riskAssessment` — `{ overallRiskLevel, concentrationRisk,
 *    vacancyRisk, interestRateSensitivity }` as strings, plus `marketRisks`
 *    (2-4) and `mitigationStrategies` (4-5) as **arrays** of strings. Nothing
 *    in the names says which is which; this was read off the table.
 *  - `analysis.strategicRecommendations` — `{ priorityActions, shortTerm,
 *    mediumTerm, longTerm }`, **all four arrays** of strings, 3-4 and 1-4.
 *  - `bestPerformer` / `worstPerformer` are whole property rows **or null**, so
 *    they are projected only when present.
 *
 * ## Units
 *
 * Measured across all 21 reports: `average_lvr` 33.17–86.57 and `average_yield`
 * 4.24–10.35 are whole-number percent, and the `percent` filter formats without
 * multiplying, so they pass through untouched. `health_score` is 25–90 — a score
 * **out of 100**, not a percentage; it is projected as a number and labelled
 * "/100" rather than set with `| percent`.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately absent
 *
 *  - `client.*` beyond the stored `client_name`. The row has `client_id`;
 *    resolving a contact is a join the caller can do.
 *  - `analysis.personalizedNarrative` and the other prose objects whose internal
 *    shape is not asserted here — projected only where the leaf is a string, so
 *    an object never reaches a template as `[object Object]`.

/**
 * The voice catalogue's own portfolio vocabulary.
 *
 * `portfolio-review` is a shipping template that predates all of this and binds
 * `portfolio.count`, `portfolio.lvr`, `portfolio.holdings.0.net` and so on. It
 * carries `report_type: 'portfolio'`, so the moment this format gained an
 * adapter it became production-ready — and a production-ready template bound to
 * a vocabulary nothing publishes renders a client's portfolio as blanks. That is
 * the exact defect `docs/reports/COVERAGE.md` records against the Compass
 * masters, and flipping the switch without this would have reintroduced it.
 *
 * Only mechanical restatements are published here. `lvr` and `grossYield` are
 * ratios of two stored totals, which is arithmetic rather than estimation;
 * `holdings` is `propertyAnalyses` under the older key names.
 *
 * Four leaves the template binds are deliberately left unresolved, because the
 * stored analysis has no counterpart and a plausible-looking guess on a client's
 * page is worse than a gap:
 *
 *  - `portfolio.growth12m` — no growth series is stored at portfolio level.
 *  - `portfolio.scores.*` — four rated category notes the analysis never writes.
 *  - `portfolio.recommendation.{headline,body}` — the analysis has one
 *    recommendation string, not a headline and a body, and splitting one into
 *    two invents an emphasis nobody wrote.
 *  - `portfolio.actions.*.{owner,timing}` — `priorityActions` is a list of
 *    strings with no owner and no due date attached.
 *
 * `portfolio-comparison` also carries `report_type: 'portfolio'` and binds
 * `drag.*`, `ranking.*` and `equity.*` — per-property growth, maintenance
 * history and equity-release scenarios. None of that is in
 * `portfolio_analysis_reports` at all, so it stays a preview-only document in
 * practice whatever the card says.
