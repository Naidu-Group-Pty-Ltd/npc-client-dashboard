/**
 * The colour-role contract for generated reports.
 *
 * Every colour a report can paint is one of these roles. The point is not
 * bookkeeping — it is that a role carries **which grounds it is legal on and
 * what contrast it must clear there**, so `printContrast.spec.ts` can iterate
 * the table and a new role cannot be added without declaring its legibility.
 *
 * This replaces four mutually incompatible palette shapes that exist today:
 * `BrandPdfPalette` (src/branding/brandPalette.ts), `THEME` and
 * `DESIGN_PALETTES` (render-investment-report-pdf/index.ts), and `BRAND`
 * (report.brand.ts) — between them the source of eight different brand golds.
