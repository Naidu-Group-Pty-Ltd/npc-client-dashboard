/**
 * The document spine — the shape every report shares, independent of what is
 * written in it.
 *
 * ## Why this is not another section registry
 *
 * `compassSectionRegistry.ts` already declares *what the sections are* for two
 * formats: their headings, word budgets, visual components, trim priorities.
 * That is content. This module declares *what a document is*: a cover, then a
 * contents, then chapters, then a closing page — and which physical page each
 * of those prints on.
 *
 * Keeping them apart is deliberate. The registry has already been mirrored by
 * hand into `src/lib/reports/` and drifted from 672 lines to 174; copying its
 * section lists into a third place would guarantee a third divergence. A caller
 * passes the registry's sections *into* `buildSpine()` — the two compose rather
 * than overlap.
 *
 * ## What this buys
 *
 * `validateSpine()` catches the structural defects that reach clients: a report
 * with two covers because a retry appended one, a disclaimer that is not last,
 * a contents page listing sections a trim pass removed, a 40-page document that
 * rendered as 12 because a data fetch failed silently. None of those are
 * detectable from the PDF bytes; all of them are detectable here, before the
 * render.
