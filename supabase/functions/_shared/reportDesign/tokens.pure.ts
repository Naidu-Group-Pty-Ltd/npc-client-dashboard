/**
 * Print tokens — GENERATED. Do not edit.
 *
 * Source: `src/styles/tokens.css` (the single source of truth for colour).
 * Generator: `scripts/reportDesign/buildTokens.ts`.
 * Regenerate: `npm run reportkit:tokens`. CI runs `:check` and fails on drift.
 *
 * ## Why these differ from the screen tokens
 *
 * Print is a different medium and the differences are not cosmetic:
 *
 *  - **Paper is warm ivory, never #FFFFFF.** A pure-white sheet against a warm
 *    cream cover reads as a printing error.
 *  - **Panels are DARKER than the sheet.** On screen the card is lighter than
 *    the page; invert that on paper or the panel disappears.
 *  - **The brand gold is a dark-ground colour.** It is
 *    7.26:1 on obsidian and only 2.10:1 on
 *    ivory — it fails at every size on paper, including the 8.5pt eyebrow that
 *    is the brand's own signature. On the cover it needs no help; on paper it
 *    steps down to `--brand-800`. Every previous attempt to fix this by
 *    eye added another literal, which is why the codebase carries eight golds.
 *  - **The floor is 4.5:1, not 7:1.** 7:1 is WCAG AAA for sustained reading;
 *    body copy is set in graphite at 13.22:1 and clears it with room
 *    to spare. The floor only ever binds on *accent* type, which is short, bold
 *    and letterspaced — AA is the right target there, and forcing AAA turns the
 *    brand gold brown.
 *  - **Category B semantics darken.** `--success` on cream is
 *    2.15:1. Hue and saturation are preserved, lightness
 *    clamped, so the colour keeps its identity and gains legibility.
 *
 * Screen values, for reference: brand #D9A520, success #21C45D,
 * warning #D9A520, destructive #EF4343, info #0284C5.
