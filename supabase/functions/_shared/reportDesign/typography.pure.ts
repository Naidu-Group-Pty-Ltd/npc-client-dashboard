/**
 * Print typography.
 *
 * ## The constraint that governs everything here
 *
 * **Only faces installed in the WeasyPrint container render.** The application
 * ships no webfonts at all — `src/branding/brand-fonts.ts` is a list of system
 * stacks — so nothing can be inherited from the UI, and a face named here but
 * absent from the image silently falls back to the engine default. That failure
 * is invisible in code review and obvious in a client's hands.
 *
 * ## What this module learned the hard way
 *
 * The previous version of this file named **Cormorant Garamond** and
 * **Fraunces** in its stacks and listed them as installed, on the strength of
 * the Dockerfile's `apt-get install fonts-cormorant-garamond fonts-fraunces`.
 * Neither package exists in Debian — bookworm or trixie — and neither does
 * `fonts-playfair-display` or `fonts-ibm-plex`. `apt-get install -y` exits
 * non-zero on an unknown package, so that `RUN` layer fails and **the image
 * could not be built at all**. The contract was never checked, so nothing said
 * so.
 *
 * `fonts-ibm-plex` survived the first attempt at this fix because it is a
 * Debian *source* package name: packages.debian.org serves a page for it, so a
 * website check reads it as available. Only the binary index disagrees. Verify
 * against `dists/<release>/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz`.
 *
 * It is checked now. `CONTAINER_FONT_PACKAGES` and `CONTAINER_FONT_FILES` are
 * the two ways a face can reach the image, `CONTAINER_INSTALLED_FAMILIES` is
 * their union, and `reportTypography.spec.ts` reads
 * `weasyprint-service/Dockerfile` and fails if any of the three disagree with
 * it — or if a stack names a family none of them provide.
 */

/**
 * Debian packages the image installs, and the families each provides.
 *

 * packages.debian.org, which also serves pages for source package names and is
 * how `fonts-ibm-plex` got into this list in the first place.

 * because Docker cannot `COPY` from outside its build context, and the
 * documented build context is the service directory.
 *
 * All are SIL OFL 1.1; a `*-OFL.txt` ships beside each family, which the licence

 *
 * ## Why the weight matters, and is declared
 *
 * A weight the stylesheet asks for and the image does not have is not a missing
 * font — it is a **synthesised** one. The engine smears the nearest face to fake
 * it, which on a high-contrast didone at 34pt reads as a printing fault rather
 * than as bold.
 *
 * The first version of this shipped Playfair Medium alone while the stylesheet
 * asked for 400, 600 and 700, so *every* chapter title and pull quote in the
 * container would have been a synthetic bold of the wrong weight. It is not
 * visible locally, where a distribution package fills the gaps.
 * `reportTypography.spec.ts` now reads the real stylesheet and fails on any
 * (family, weight) pair this table cannot answer exactly.
