/**
 * Reading an audit entry.
 *
 * `calculate-borrowing-capacity` records every transformation it applies as
 * `{ category, action, label, rawValue, assessedValue, delta, impact, rule }`
 * — seven fields, of which two are bare numbers whose meaning lives entirely in
 * the other five. The shipping report ignores those five, prints both numbers
 * as dollars, and colours the delta by its arithmetic sign.
 *
 * Two things follow from that, and this module is both of them:
 *
 *  1. **Units** (`BORROWING_CAPACITY.md` F2, F13). The unit of `rawValue` is a
 *     function of `(category, action)` — and for liability entries it is not
 *     the same unit as `assessedValue`, which is why their delta is nonsense.
 *  2. **Direction** (F6). Whether a change helped or hurt the client is also a
 *     function of `(category, action)`, not of the sign of the delta. A HEM
 *     floor that adds $700 to assessed expenses has a *positive* delta and
 *     *reduces* capacity.
 *
 * Both tables are keyed by the action strings the Edge Function actually emits.
 * `auditCoverage.spec.ts` reads that file and fails if it emits one this module
 * does not know — so a new audit entry surfaces as a red test, not as a silent
 * grey row in a client's report.
