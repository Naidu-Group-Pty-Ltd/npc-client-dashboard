/**
 * The three pictures this document has a use for.
 *
 * Not three that could be drawn — three that answer a question the tables answer
 * slowly. Every one takes the payload it is drawn from, so a chart cannot
 * disagree with the table beside it.
 *
 *   Utilisation   A bullet. "Is the loan they want inside what they can
 *                 borrow, and by how much?" is a comparison against a limit,
 *                 which is the one thing a bullet chart is for.
 *   Income mix    A donut. Which components carry the serviceability, after
 *                 shading — a proportion, and small in number.
 *   Headroom      Bars. Capacity, the stress-tested capacity and the proposed
 *                 loan on one axis. The reader currently does that comparison
 *                 in their head, across two pages.
 *
 * Two others were drawn and removed, which is the more useful half of this
 * module's history:
 *
 *   A **waterfall** of the monthly build-up. Its total came to ~$8,150 against
 *   the $1,840 surplus printed under it, because the engine's surplus is after
 *   tax and after property cashflow and the payload does not carry those as
 *   monthly steps. A picture that disagrees with the figure beside it is worse
 *   than no picture, and the fix is not to draw it from numbers that reconcile
 *   by construction — there are none.
 *
 *   **Bars of the scenario capacities.** The scenario table already sorts and
 *   compares exactly those three numbers; bars of them beside it are
 *   decoration, and they cost a page.
 *
 * No chart is load-bearing. Each returns `''` when its data is absent or
 * degenerate, and the section around it prints its table either way: a client
 * with one income component does not need a donut of one segment.
