/**
 * Which sections this document has, and how long it claims to be.
 *
 * Structure, decided before anything is drawn. The shipping generator has no
 * such thing: it draws 19 steps in a row, each one deciding for itself whether
 * to `doc.addPage()`, so the only way to find out that a document lost its
 * audit trail is to open the PDF and count (`BORROWING_CAPACITY.md` §2).
 *
 * A spine is checkable. `validateSpine` catches a section with no title, a
 * non-positive page budget, a slot the `borrowing-capacity` archetype does not
 * permit, and a total outside its [4, 12] band — all before the HTML exists.
