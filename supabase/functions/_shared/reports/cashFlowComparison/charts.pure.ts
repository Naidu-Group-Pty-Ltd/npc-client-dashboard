/**
 * The three pictures this document has a use for.
 *
 * Two landscape matrices already state every figure. A chart earns its page only
 * by answering something a matrix answers slowly, and across five properties and
 * ten years there are exactly three such questions:
 *
 *   How far apart?   The ranking gives an order. Whether first place is a
 *                    decision or a coin toss is a gap, and five numbers in a
 *                    column do not show a gap.
 *   Sweep or split?  Eight categories are won by somebody. Whether one property
 *                    took most of them or they split four ways is visible
 *                    nowhere in a table of winners.
 *   When does it     The matrix carries the cumulative row, but finding where
 *   stop costing?    each property's sign flips means scanning fifty cells for
 *                    a minus sign — and whether two curves cross is invisible
 *                    in a grid.
 *
 * All three are drawn from the payload the tables are drawn from, so none can
 * disagree with the page it sits on. All three return `''` when there is nothing
 * to draw, and every section prints its table either way.
 *
 * The multi-line chart is written here rather than taken from the shared module
 * because the shared module has no multi-series line and adding one for a single
 * caller is how a chart library grows things nobody uses — the rule
 * `cashFlow/charts.pure.ts` states for its stacked column. If a second format
 * wants it, that is when it moves.
 *
 * ## Two charts the shared module offers and this format cannot use
 *
 * **`renderQuadrant`** was the obvious candidate — growth against yield, the
 * classic two axes — and it is wrong here twice over. It maps values with
 * `xOf(v) = padL + (v / xMax) * plotW` (`charts.pure.ts:794`), so a negative
 * point is drawn left of the plot rectangle; and both candidate axes go
 * negative in normal use, because `netYield` is
 * `((annualRent - totalExpenses) / propertyValue) * 100`
 * (`CashFlowAnalysisModal.tsx:636`) and `capitalGrowthRate` is a per-year field
 * an adviser stress-testing a downturn types a minus sign into. The dividers
 * would be wrong too: CPI and the interest rate are per-property here, so one
 * property's assumption would have to become everyone's threshold, and picking
 * the primary's privileges the primary in a document whose whole posture is
 * equal peers.
 *
 * **`renderHeatmap`** would put cash flow on a property × year grid, which is
 * the right shape. But it prints raw numbers — `Number.isInteger(v) ? String(v)
 * : v.toFixed(1)` (`:456`), so `-8432.17` reaches a client's page as `-8432.2`,
 * with no currency and no separator — and it ramps one hue linearly from the
 * grid minimum, so a year at −$8,000 and a year at +$400 differ only in alpha
 * and the sign change is invisible. Making it fit means a formatter hook *and* a
 * diverging ramp, and at the end of that the banded matrix on the facing page
 * still says it better: `renderBandedMatrix` passes `signedKeys`, so negatives
 * take the negative tone through `renderDataTable` and every figure is a number
 * a reader can quote.
