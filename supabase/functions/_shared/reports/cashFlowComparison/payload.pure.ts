/**
 * What a Cash Flow Comparison Analysis says, as a shape.
 *
 * ## This format is N of another format
 *
 * A cash flow comparison is two to five 10 Year Cash Flow Analyses read side by
 * side. So a `ComparedProperty` **holds** a `CashFlowProjection` rather than
 * restating one: the same `ProjectionYear`, built by the same
 * `cashFlow/normalise.pure.ts`, with the same units attached in the same place.
 *
 * Declaring a second, comparison-flavoured projected year would create two
 * answers to "what is a projected year", and the two would drift on the first
 * field either side added. That is the failure mode this whole programme exists
 * to remove, so importing the sibling format is not a shortcut here — it is the
 * design. `cashFlowComparisonSourceOfTruth.spec.ts` permits exactly that one
 * extra directory and nothing else.
 *
 * ## The numbers are the document; the analysis is enrichment
 *
 * This is the first comparison format with real deterministic figures. The
 * Property Comparison had none — its source was stored model output and nothing
 * else — whereas every number here is arithmetic the browser performed and the
 * adviser reviewed.
 *
 * So the shape puts them first. `properties` and `scoreboard` are always
 * present and always render. `analysis` is optional, because
 * `compare-cash-flow-reports` is a button an adviser may never press, and a
 * comparison with no model narrative is a complete, sendable document. The
 * legacy path takes the opposite view — `exportAiAnalysisPDF` returns without
 * drawing anything when there is no analysis — which is why there is no way to
 * hand a client the ten years they just watched being edited.
 *
 * ## Two break-evens, named apart
 *
 * `cashFlow/normalise.pure.ts`'s `toOutcome` calls "break-even" the first year
 * whose *annual* cash flow is non-negative. `CashFlowAnalysisModal`'s
 * `calculateAdvancedMetrics` calls "break-even" the year *cumulative* cash flow
 * turns non-negative. Both are useful and they are rarely the same year, so this
 * payload carries both under names that cannot be confused —
 * `firstPositiveYear` and `paybackYear` — and the document prints both with a
 * line saying which is which. Picking one and calling it break-even would put a
 * number on a client's page that disagrees with the screen it came from.

// ── The optional model narrative ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Shapes mirror `compare-cash-flow-reports/index.ts:160-204`, with every field
// optional. The producer is a language model behind a JSON instruction; it is
// not a schema, and a payload type that insisted otherwise would refuse a
// document over a missing sentence.
//
// ## Why almost nothing here names a property
//
// The producer's schema points at properties with a bare 1-based
// `propertyNumber`. That number is the index into `propertiesData`
// (`compare-cash-flow-reports/index.ts:78`), which is built by mapping over
// `reports` — the result of `.in('id', reportIds)` at `:58`. **Postgres does not
// guarantee that `IN` returns rows in the order the ids were given.** So
// `propertyNumber` names a position in an ordering that exists only inside that
// one function call and was never recorded anywhere.
//
// Resolving it here to an address would assert a mapping the record does not
// contain — and would do it silently, on a client's page, naming a specific
// property beside a claim that may belong to a different one. The on-screen
// panel avoids this by printing only `.reason` and never naming a property
// (`CashFlowAnalysisModal.tsx:5265`, `:5271`, `:5277`, `:5283`, `:5294`), and
// this payload does the same.
//
// `finalRankings` is the exception, and only because the producer instructs the
// model to echo the `address` back (`:192`). A ranking is matched on that
// string; one that does not match any property is kept with `property: null`
// and printed by its own text.
//
// The fix is one line in the producer — enumerate `reportIds` rather than
// `reports` — and it is out of scope here for the same reason the Property
// Comparison's producer defects were. It is the only thing standing between this
// format and attributed model prose, and `CASH_FLOW_COMPARISON.md` records it.
