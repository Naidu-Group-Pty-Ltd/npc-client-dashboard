/**
 * The comparison as HTML, through the design system.
 *
 * ## What the two generators this sits beside actually produce
 *
 * `exportComparisonPDF` rasterises three on-screen charts with `html2canvas`,
 * prints an eight-row metrics table, and appends whatever the model wrote.
 * `exportAiAnalysisPDF` prints the model and nothing else — and returns without
 * drawing anything at all when there is no analysis
 * (`CashFlowAnalysisModal.tsx:1947`). So the ten years of arithmetic the adviser
 * just spent the session editing have never reached a client's document in any
 * form.
 *
 * Here they are the document. The matrices open landscape pages because that is
 * what a wide numeric table needs, the model's prose sits after the figures it
 * describes rather than instead of them, and a comparison with no analysis is a
 * complete report rather than an empty one.
 *
 * ## Every model-authored string is escaped, and never as HTML
 *
 * `renderCallout`, `renderDecisionBox` and `renderSidenote` all take **raw
 * HTML** for their bodies. Model text reaches them only through `p()`, `subhead()` or
 * `renderList()` below, each of which escapes. Passing a model string straight
 * into a `bodyHtml` parameter is the one mistake in this file that would not
 * show up on a page until it did.
 *
 * ## Nothing here attributes model prose to a property
 *
 * The producer points at properties with a bare `propertyNumber` indexing an
 * ordering that existed only inside one edge-function call — see the long note
 * in `payload.pure.ts`. So the notes print as prose, exactly as the on-screen
 * panel does, and only `finalRankings` is attributed, on the address the
 * producer instructs the model to echo back.
