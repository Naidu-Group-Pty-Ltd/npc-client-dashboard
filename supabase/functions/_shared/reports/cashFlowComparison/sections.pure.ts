/**
 * What the document contains, and in what order.
 *
 * ## The verdict goes first
 *
 * The producer writes its recommendation last (`compare-cash-flow-reports`
 * schema, `:199`) and the legacy generators print it near the end. Someone who
 * put five properties side by side does not need walking to the answer — the
 * same inversion the Portfolio and the Property Comparison already took.
 *
 * ## The tables are the document
 *
 * Sections 1–5 and 10 are arithmetic and always present. Sections 6–9 exist only
 * when the adviser pressed "Generate AI Analysis", and each of the four is
 * **independently** conditional rather than gated as a block.
 *
 * That is not defensive coding. `compare-cash-flow-reports:219` asks for eight
 * sections with `maxTokens: 4000`, and a response that closes its braces early
 * still parses — so a partial analysis is a normal arrival, not an error, and
 * `overallRecommendation` is simultaneously the last thing written and the first
 * thing an adviser looks for. Gating all four together would drop three present
 * sections because a fourth ran out of budget.
 *
 * A comparison with no analysis at all is a complete, sendable document. That is
 * the whole point of the migration: today `exportAiAnalysisPDF` returns without
 * drawing anything when `aiAnalysis` is null (`CashFlowAnalysisModal.tsx:1947`),
 * so there is no way to hand a client the ten years they just watched an adviser
 * edit.
