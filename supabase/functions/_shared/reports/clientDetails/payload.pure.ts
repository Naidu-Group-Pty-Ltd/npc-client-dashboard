/**
 * What a Client Details report says, as a shape.
 *
 * ## The document is about a person, not a portfolio
 *
 * The generator this replaces leads with the property portfolio: Properties
 * Overview, per-property blocks, Portfolio Summary. Measured against the record,
 * **26 of 771 clients have any property at all**. For the other 745 the shipping
 * PDF is a cover, some contact details, and several pages of empty tables.
 *
 * So the shape here puts the person first and makes the portfolio conditional.
 * `household` and `position` are always present; `properties` is routinely
 * empty and the document simply does not have those sections when it is.
 *
 * ## Everything is persisted, so the server reads it
 *
 * Unlike the cash flow formats, nothing here is computed live in a modal against
 * unsaved overrides. Every figure comes from a row in one of nine tables, so the
 * server reads them and the browser sends only a client id. That also means this
 * document can be produced without anyone opening the client.
 *
 * ## No emoji
 *
 * The legacy headings carry `🏠 Owner Occupied`, `📈 Investment`, `🏛️ SMSF`,
 * `💸 Personal Expenses`, and `✓ ✗ ⏳ ▲ ▼ ●` for compliance and cash-flow
 * direction. That is safe when every page is a raster of the browser's own
 * rendering and unsafe the moment the page is real text: the design system's
 * faces carry no emoji coverage, so WeasyPrint would set them as tofu. Every one
 * of them is a word or a sign in this payload.
