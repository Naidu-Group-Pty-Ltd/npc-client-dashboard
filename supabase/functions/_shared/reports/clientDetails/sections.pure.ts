/**
 * What the document contains, and in what order.
 *
 * ## The person first, the portfolio last and only if there is one
 *
 * The generator this replaces opens on Properties Overview. Measured against the
 * record, 745 of 771 clients have no property — so for almost everybody the
 * shipping document leads with, and then spends several pages on, nothing.
 *
 * Here sections 1 and 8 are unconditional and everything between them appears
 * only when the record holds it. A client with a name and an address produces a
 * five-page document that reads as finished, because it is: it says who they
 * are and where they stand, and it does not pretend to a portfolio.
 *
 * ## Where they stand is always last, and always there
 *
 * Even for a record with nothing but a name. The position is then all zeroes and
 * says so in one line, which is a true and useful statement — "we hold no
 * financial information for this client" is exactly what an adviser about to
 * send this to a broker needs to see before they send it.
