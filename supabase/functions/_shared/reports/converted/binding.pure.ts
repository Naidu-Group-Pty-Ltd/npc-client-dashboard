/**
 * Tying a converted template to an existing report format.
 *
 * ## What binding is for
 *
 * A converted template on its own is a nicely typeset copy of somebody's old
 * document. It becomes useful when it is attached to a **report format** — one
 * of the archetypes in `reportDesign/structure.pure.ts` — because then the
 * format's own structure sections drive the document, and the real report data
 * flows into it at render time instead of the words that happened to be in the
 * PDF somebody uploaded.
 *
 * So binding answers one question per archetype chapter: *which section of the
 * uploaded template plays this part?*
 *
 * ## Suggested, then confirmed — never silently guessed
 *
 * `proposeBinding` scores each extracted section against each archetype
 * chapter and returns its best guess **with the score attached**. The UI shows
 * those and a person confirms or overrides them. Nothing here decides anything
 * on its own, and that is deliberate: a wrong automatic binding produces a
 * document where the "Risks" chapter is filled with the fee schedule, which
 * looks entirely correct and is completely wrong. A visible low score is
 * recoverable; a silent mismatch is not.
 *
 * The scorer is intentionally simple — token overlap, order proximity, and a
 * nudge for tabular sections landing on tabular chapters. A cleverer matcher
 * would be more often right and much harder to argue with when it is wrong,
 * and the person confirming is looking at both lists anyway.

/**
 * The chapters a report format contributes, by archetype.
 *
 * The archetypes themselves declare a document *name*, slots and a page band —
 * they do not enumerate chapters, because for the migrated formats the chapters
 * come from the payload. A converter has no payload yet, so the format's
 * expected sections have to be written down somewhere, and this is that place.
 *
 * ## These are the renderer's own titles, and a spec proves it
 *
 * Every string below appears verbatim in the section function named above each
 * list — `borrowingCapacity/sections.pure.ts › snapshotSections` and its six
 * siblings. `converterChapters.spec.ts` imports each of those functions, builds
 * the payload that makes the format print everything it can, and asserts the
 * two lists are equal in the same order. Nothing here is typed from memory.
 *
 * The first version of this list did not. It said `Position Summary`, `Income`,
 * `Commitments`, `Serviceability`, `Capacity & Scenarios`, `Assumptions`,
 * `Next Steps` — seven noun phrases taken from the archetype's *description*,
 * not one of which the renderer prints. A comment right here claimed they were
 * "taken from each format's shipped document rather than invented"; they were
 * invented, and the cost was measurable: converting a real Borrowing Capacity
 * Snapshot bound 3 of 7 chapters and sent 3 sections to the appendix, because
 * the document's actual chapters are editorial sentences and the list was
 * functional labels. A binding list that does not match the renderer is worse
 * than no list, because it fails while looking like it works.
 *
 * Conditional chapters are listed too. Most of these formats emit a section
 * only when the payload has something to put in it — Borrowing Capacity's last
 * three need an explanation, an audit or scenarios; Client Details omits `Where
 * they live` for a renter. Every one is offered here regardless, because an
 * unfilled chapter is a state the document already handles and a template that
 * *does* carry an audit section should be able to bind it. So each list below
 * is the longest the format can print, in printed order.
 *
 * ## Where the term-dependent titles come from
 *
 * Two Cash Flow titles interpolate the projection's term —
 * `The ${termYears}-year projection`. A converted template has no payload and
 * therefore no term, so the literal has to choose one, and it is ten: the
 * catalogue standard, and what the spec's payload is built at. Nothing is lost
 * by choosing wrong, because `tokens()` discards anything two characters or
 * shorter and `10` never reaches the scorer.

/**
 * Formats whose chapters are the uploaded template's own sections.
 *
 * ## Why Report Q&A cannot have a list
 *
 * Every format above declares its chapters in code. Report Q&A does not, and
 * the difference is not an oversight to be tidied up: `planFromTurns` titles a
 * chapter with the client's own question, and `planFromMarkdown` uses whatever
 * headings the answer happens to carry. There is no set of strings that could
 * be written here and be true.
 *
 * Writing one anyway is exactly the failure this module's header records — an
 * invented list that binds a few chapters, sends the rest to the appendix, and
 * looks entirely correct while doing it. So the honest answer is that this
 * format contributes a spine, a page band, a chapter label and a document name,
 * and the template supplies the chapters. Every section is accounted for, in
 * order, and nothing goes to the appendix.
 *
 * ## One heading level, not every heading
 *
 * The chapters are the template's *top-level* sections. The first version bound
 * every extracted section, and a render said what that costs: a Snapshot whose
 * 19 sections are 8 `##` and 11 two-line `###` came out as 19 chapters, so
 * fourteen of its twenty-one body pages carried a heading and one to three
 * lines. `.chapter { page-break-before: always }` is global, so a chapter is a
 * sheet, and eight two-line sub-headings became eight sheets.
 *
 * That is the same defect `planConvertedChapters` records fixing for the
 * declarative formats, arriving by a different door: its folding rule skips
 * anything the binding wanted, and a pass-through binding wanted everything.
 * The real Report Q&A renderer already agrees — `planFromMarkdown` picks one
 * heading level with `chapterLevelOf` and everything below it stays in the
 * prose. So a section with a shallower section before it is left to fold into
 * it, and nothing is lost.
