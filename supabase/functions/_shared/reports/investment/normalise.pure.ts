/**
 * Reading an investment report row.
 *
 * Six jsonb columns and one very large Markdown column, none of which has a
 * schema the database enforces. Every reader here is defensive in the same way
 * the other seven normalisers are: a missing branch produces `null`, never a
 * zero, because a zero is a measurement and a null is an absence, and the
 * document draws them differently — a chart with a null is not drawn at all,
 * while a chart with a zero claims the property scored nothing.
 *
 * ## The sensitivity data is one-way, and that decides the chart
 *
 * `sensitivityAnalysis` holds two independent objects — `interestRateChanges`
 * with three scenarios and `rentChanges` with three — and **not** a grid. The
 * generator being replaced draws a heatmap from them, which asks a reader to
 * read a cross-product ("rent +10% *and* rates +1%") that was never computed.
 * The design system's `renderHeatmap` would make the same false claim more
 * beautifully. So this module returns two one-way series and the document draws
 * a tornado, which is what one-way sensitivity data actually is.
 *
 * ## The projections are three scenarios, not one line
 *
 * `projections` holds `conservative`, `moderate` and `optimistic`, each a
 * ten-year array. Printing only the moderate case — which is what a single line
 * would do — throws away the range, and the range is the point of a projection.
 * The document draws all three as a fan.

 * where its lookahead can match: the newline immediately after the heading. So
 * the heading was removed and every word beneath it was kept, then swept into

/**
 * Which infographic belongs under which section, when nothing is numbered.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `SECTION_CHARTS` keys the fourteen named infographics on the generator's own
 * section numbers — `24: ['sensitivity-tornado']` — and that was right for the
 * format it was read off. The generator has since stopped numbering. Measured
 * over the whole corpus:
 *
 * | reports | numbered headings |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | 1,147 without `{{…}}` figures | 733 numbered |
 * | **35 with them — every current report** | **0 numbered** |
 *
 * So on every report the product makes today, `SECTION_CHARTS[null]` is
 * nothing, and not one of the fourteen charts drawn from the structured jsonb
 * columns reaches the page. Those columns are the whole reason the migration
 * exists: the score breakdown, the household profile, the cost lines and the
 * projections appear nowhere else in the document.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * Title keywords, read off the section names the current generator actually
 * writes — `Executive Verdict`, `Risk Dashboard`, `Population & Housing
 * Demand`, `Financial Input Snapshot` — and **each chart attaches at most
 * once**, to the first section that matches it. Order in this list is the
 * order the charts are claimed in, not a priority: two sections that both
 * mention amenity get one bullet chart between them, under the first.
 *
 * A chart still only draws if `chartHasData` says its column is populated, so
 * a generous pattern costs nothing but a counted skip. That asymmetry is
 * deliberate — a missed chart is invisible, a spurious one cannot happen.
