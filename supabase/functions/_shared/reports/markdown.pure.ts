/**
 * Markdown, as the report design system sets it.
 *
 * Written for the Report Q&A export, which was the first format whose payload
 * was prose rather than typed figures, and moved here when the Market
 * Intelligence report turned out to be the second. Both store model-authored
 * Markdown in a column and need it turned into the system's own HTML without
 * either losing what the model said or letting it say anything.
 *
 * The move is the same one `neutraliseUrls` made for the same reason: two
 * callers is where a second copy starts, and a second Markdown parser is a
 * second set of the defects recorded below.
 *
 * ## What the record actually contains
 *
 * Measured across the 562 assistant answers in `report_qa_messages`
 * (`coalesce(edited_content, content)`), because a grammar guessed from
 * CommonMark would be both too large and, in two places, too small:
 *
 * | construct | answers |     | construct | answers |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | inline bold | 392 (70%) |  | blockquote | 18 |
 * | bullet list | 321 (57%) |  | inline code | 6 |
 * | ATX heading | 270 (48%) |  | fenced code | 6 |
 * | inline italic | 193 (34%) || thematic break | 3 |
 * | ordered list | 181 (32%) || bare URL | 7 |
 * | pipe table | 105 (19%) |  | markdown link | **0** |
 * | smart punctuation | 389 || markdown image | 1 |
 *
 * Heading levels used: `#` 290, `##` 1,214, `###` 1,536, `####` 192, `#####` 5.
 * Tables run to **14 columns** and 101 rows. Dingbats appear in 98 answers,
 * arrows in 89, **variation selector 16 in 93**, pictographs in 16.
 *
 * ## Three rules the stylesheet imposes
 *
 * `css.pure.ts` styles `h1, h2, h3` (`:635`), `h4` (`:649`), `p` (`:660`),
 * `strong` (`:666`), `em` (`:667`), `a` (`:668`), `ul, ol` (`:673`), `li`
 * (`:674`) and the whole `table.data` system (`:239-344`). It styles **nothing**
 * for `h5`, `h6`, `blockquote` as an element, `code`, `pre`, `hr` or `img`.
 *
 * 1. **`h4` is not a small heading.** It is IBM Plex Mono, uppercase, tracked,
 *    at caption size — the comment at `css.pure.ts:647` says it is the same
 *    object as `.eyebrow`. It is a real level to demote onto, but it reads as a
 *    labelled sub-section, which is why the clamp stops there rather than
 *    marching on into unstyled `h5`.
 * 2. **`<pre>` is disqualified.** WeasyPrint's UA sheet gives it
 *    `white-space: pre`, and there is no `overflow-wrap` or `word-break` rule
 *    anywhere in the sheet — so a 120-character line of JSON would run off the
 *    trim edge of a client's document. A fenced block becomes a callout of
 *    `<code>` separated by `<br>`, which wraps.
 * 3. Everything the sheet already styles is emitted as that element. Only the
 *    unstyled constructs go through a primitive, whose *classes* it does style.
 *
 * ## Never repairs, and never throws
 *
 * The block scan is one left-to-right pass in the house style of
 * `propertyComparison/salvage.pure.ts:180`. A table without a delimiter row is
 * not a table; seven hashes are not a heading; a ten-digit ordinal is not a
 * list. Each falls through to a paragraph, which is the honest reading of what
 * was written. Nothing is fabricated to make a construct parse.
 *
 * And nothing throws. A caller who hands over 350 KB gets a truncated document
 * and a notice saying so — the same choice `measure.pure.ts:249` makes returning
 * `null` rather than throwing, and for the same reason: a pure formatter that
 * throws takes the whole render down and the caller has no better recovery.

 *  - `≤` -> `<=`, `→` -> `->`, `•` -> `-`, all fully covered by the installed faces;
 *  - **every non-Latin name**, which is what `fonts-noto-cjk` is installed for.
 *
 * Dropping the 16 answers' pictographs outright is still right, because the
 * house vocabulary is decorative-prefix-plus-word — `clientDetails/render.pure.ts`
 * documents the same list in its own "No emoji" section — so `🏠 Owner Occupied`
 * becomes `Owner Occupied` and reads perfectly. The coloured circles are dropped

/**
 * Escape first, then apply emphasis over the escaped string.
 *
 * ## Why this order and not the other
 *
 * Both can be made correct. This one is chosen for its **failure mode**.
 * Escape-first puts `escapeHtml` at one auditable call at the top of this
 * function; get it wrong — parse emphasis first and escape the result — and the
 * page prints `&lt;strong&gt;` in the body copy. Loud, and the first test
 * catches it. The alternative, building an AST and escaping at serialisation, is
 * correct only if *every* serialiser branch remembers to; the branch that
 * forgets is an XSS-shaped hole that renders identically to correct output in
 * every test that does not specifically probe it.
 *
 * ## The property that makes it safe
 *
 * `escapeHtml` (`primitives.pure.ts:34`) produces only `&amp; &lt; &gt; &quot;
 * &#39;`, and **none of `*`, `_`, backtick, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)` appears in any of
 * those five entities**. So no marker can land inside an entity and no emphasis
 * span can split one. `markdown.spec.ts` asserts that directly, so adding a
 * sixth entity to `escapeHtml` fails here rather than in a client's document.
 *
 * Two rules follow, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - the scanner anchors only on those seven characters, never on `&` or `;`;
 *  - every length cap is applied to the **raw** text, because a run of `&` grows
 *    fivefold under escaping.
 */
/**
 * The footnote registry for the render in flight.
 *
 * `[^id]` references can appear anywhere inline text does — paragraphs, list
 * items, table cells — and every one of those paths already funnels through
 * `renderInlineMarkdown`, so the reference substitution lives there. The
 * definitions are document-level state, and threading a map through a dozen
 * call sites would change every signature for one feature; a module-ambient
 * registry set for the duration of one `renderMarkdown` call (this module is
 * synchronous and single-threaded in both runtimes) is the smaller surface.
 * Null outside a render: a bare `renderInlineMarkdown` caller sees `[^id]`
 * dropped only when a render established definitions for it.
