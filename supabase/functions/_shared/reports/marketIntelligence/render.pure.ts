/**
 * A Market Intelligence report as HTML, through the design system.
 *
 * ## What this replaces, and what was actually wrong with it
 *
 * Not the structure. `MarketIntelligencePDFGenerator` is a careful 1,159-line
 * jsPDF document — eight named layers in a deliberate order, a table of
 * contents, branded insight cards, colour-coded strategy panels, an events
 * timeline. It draws vectors, not rasters, so unlike the Client Details and Q&A
 * generators its text is already selectable.
 *
 * What is wrong with it is what it does to the content on the way in, and four
 * defects in the drawing:
 *
 *  - **Table cells are hard-truncated.** `.slice(0, 30)` on a header and
 *    `.slice(0, 35)` on a body cell (`:486`, `:499`), with no wrapping and no
 *    per-column measurement. Measured against the record: the corpus holds 10
 *    tables of 72 rows, the widest cell is **322 characters**, and **40.3% of
 *    all table rows lose content** to that cap. Layer 5's own prompt demands a
 *    four-column risk matrix with six or more rows (`index.ts:792-803`), so the
 *    section the document builds toward is the one most damaged.
 *  - **The footer prints on the cover.** `drawCoverPage` does `this.pageNum++`
 *    (`:217`) without going through `addPage`, so the first real `addPage()`
 *    sees `pageNum > 0`, calls `drawFooter()`, and lays a gold rule and
 *    "Page 1" over the navy cover art.
 *  - **The audience badge is measured at the wrong size.** `getTextWidth` is
 *    called at `:259` while the font is still 36pt from the title (`:243`), and
 *    the text is drawn at 9pt (`:262`) — so the gold badge is roughly four times
 *    wider than the word inside it.
 *  - **The contents page lists sections that were never printed.** It is built
 *    from `includedLayers` alone (`:301-345`), and 6 of the record's 46 layer
 *    bodies came back empty. It also carries no page numbers.
 *
 * And `sanitise` (`:86-91`) strips every character outside Latin-1 — the same
 * over-reach the Report Q&A migration records, here removing nothing it was
 * written to remove, because the corpus contains no pictographs and no dingbats
 * at all.
 *
 * ## Two colour systems in one document
 *
 * The body is drawn from thirteen hardcoded constants — `NAVY {13,38,77}`,
 * `GOLD {191,155,80}` (the `#BF9B50` this design system retired) and eleven
 * more — while the closing page comes from `drawJsPDFDisclaimerPage`, which was
 * already migrated and takes `DEFAULT_PALETTE`. So the last page of every market
 * intelligence PDF has been on the design system while the preceding twenty
 * were not.
 *
 * ## The marketing copy is carried, from the pinned brand
 *
 * Three blocks are hardcoded English rather than model output: the per-audience
 * insight panels, a "Why <Brand>?" callout, and a "Ready to Take the Next Step?"
 * box. They are kept — somebody wrote them for a client-facing document — but
 * the brand name comes from the snapshot rather than a second
 * `fetchGlobalReportSettings` round trip, so the document stops having two ideas
 * of who the company is.
 *
 * ## The legacy generator stays
 *
 * This is a second path. `MarketIntelligencePDFGenerator` still draws its
 * document, and both the export button and the history modal still reach it.
