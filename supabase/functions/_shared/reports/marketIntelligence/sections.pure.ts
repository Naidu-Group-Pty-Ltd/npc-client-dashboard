/**
 * The spine: which sections a report has, and how many pages each claims.
 *
 * Declared rather than discovered, unlike the Report Q&A's. This format has a
 * fixed vocabulary of fifteen possible sections, and which appear is a question
 * about which parts of the payload have content — the same rule the Client
 * Details and Portfolio documents follow. What is *inside* a section is model
 * prose, but the section list is the format's.
 *
 * ## An empty layer is named, not listed
 *
 * Six of the record's 46 layer bodies are empty strings, because the edge
 * function runs layers 1/2/3/6/7 in parallel with a `.catch` that returns empty
 * (`generate-market-intelligence-report/index.ts:616-652`). The generator being
 * replaced still puts those layers in its table of contents — the TOC is built
 * from `includedLayers` alone (`MarketIntelligencePDFGenerator.ts:301-345`) —
 * and then prints no section for them, so the numbering silently drifts and a
 * reader counting sections finds one missing with no explanation.
 *
 * Here an empty layer gets **no chapter and no contents entry**, and the
 * document says which layers returned nothing in its opening lede. The contents
 * page cannot list something that was not printed, which is the one structural
 * assertion every format in this programme carries.
