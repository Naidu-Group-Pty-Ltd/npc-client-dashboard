/**
 * The three pictures this document has a use for.
 *
 * The holdings matrix states every figure. A chart earns its page only by
 * answering something that matrix answers slowly, and in a table of twenty
 * columns there are three such questions:
 *
 *   Where the money is   Is this portfolio concentrated? The risk section
 *                        asserts an answer to that in prose and nothing on the
 *                        page shows it; finding out from the table means
 *                        ranking every holding by eye.
 *   Yield against LVR    Which properties are the problem, and are they the
 *                        problem for the *same* reason? The rankings list them
 *                        1…n with prose, but neither the list nor the matrix
 *                        shows that two low-ranked holdings are both high-LVR
 *                        and low-yield — one problem, one action — while a
 *                        third is low-LVR and low-yield, which is different.
 *   Capacity headroom    How much room is left? A comparison against a limit,
 *                        which is what a bullet chart is for.
 *
 * Four were drawn or considered and left out, which is the more useful half of
 * this module's history:
 *
 *   A **waterfall** from portfolio value to equity, or from today's value to
 *   the projection. The Borrowing Capacity format deleted its waterfall after
 *   it totalled ~$8,150 against the $1,840 printed beneath it. Here it would be
 *   worse: the projection is *model-written*, arriving as finished numbers with
 *   no intermediate steps, so a waterfall would have to invent the steps that
 *   reconcile them.
 *
 *   A **score wheel** over the review's five scores. The data begs for it and
 *   the axes are not independent — the review wizard derives growth potential
 *   from the health score and copies the health score into cash flow for
 *   owner-occupied holdings. A radar over numbers computed from one another
 *   draws a shape that is an artefact of the formula.
 *
 *   **Bars of per-property cash flow.** That is the matrix's cash-flow column
 *   drawn a second time.
 *
 *   A **gauge** on the headline health score, which is already the largest
 *   thing on the page in the KPI strip.
 *
 * No chart is load-bearing. Each returns `''` when its data is absent or
 * degenerate, and the section prints its table either way.
