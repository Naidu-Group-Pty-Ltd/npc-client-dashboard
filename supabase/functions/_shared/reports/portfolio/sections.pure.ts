/**
 * What the document contains, and in what order.
 *
 * ## Nine sections out of twenty
 *
 * The legacy generator draws twenty content blocks in one continuous flow.
 * Nine is not a trim of twenty; it is the observation that twenty blocks are
 * not twenty subjects. Five pairs are one subject drawn twice, or drawn in two
 * places because the drawing order forced it — the property table and the
 * property cashflow cards, financial health and risk, growth opportunities and
 * strategic recommendations and the twelve-month plan, market conditions and
 * projections, borrowing capacity utilisation and the borrowing capacity pack.
 *
 * ## Why the contents page is generated
 *
 * The legacy builds one by hand from a counter that starts at 3 and is
 * incremented as entries are pushed, six of them without incrementing at all.
 * Nothing reconciles it against the real page count, and nothing could: every
 * section paginates against its own measured content, so where a section lands
 * is not knowable until it is drawn. `contentsEntriesFor` derives the list from
 * this spine instead, and page numbers come from `@page` counters — so neither
 * can claim something that was not printed.
 *
 * ## The holdings budget is the only data-dependent one
 *
 * Both other formats hardcode every budget and are right to: a cash flow
 * projection is always ten years, a capacity assessment always one capacity. A
 * portfolio is between one and thirty-odd properties, so a fixed budget would
 * be wrong for most of them and the spine-versus-render assertion would either
 * fail constantly or be set so loose it asserted nothing.
