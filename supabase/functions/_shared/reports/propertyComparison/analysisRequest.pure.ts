/**
 * What `compare-investment-reports` asks the model for, and how its answer is read.
 *
 * ## The failure this exists to end
 *
 * The producer asked a **thinking** model — `report_comparison` is assigned
 * `google/gemini-2.5-pro` in `agent_model_assignments` — for a ten-section JSON
 * document under a flat `maxTokens: 12000`, described in prose, with no
 * `response_format`, and then wrote whatever came back into the row. Three
 * things went wrong, and each one alone leaves a client with a report missing
 * nine of its ten sections:
 *
 * 1. **The budget is shared with reasoning.** `max_tokens` is the *whole* output
 *    allowance and a 2.5-series model spends thousands of it thinking before it
 *    writes a character. The damage tracks the property count exactly — 0 of 7
 *    two-property comparisons, 16 of 17 five-property ones — which is the
 *    signature of an output ceiling, not of a model that cannot answer.
 * 2. **Nothing asked for JSON except the prose.** 8 stored rows still carry a
 *    ```json fence; 4 close their own brace and still do not parse (one has `]`
 *    where `}` belongs, at line 225 of 251).
 * 3. **Every one of those outcomes was stored as a success** — 200,
 *    `success: true`, seven NULL columns — so nothing retried and nothing said.
 *
 * 30 of 53 stored comparisons are in that state, including the most recent.
 *
 * ## What this module decides, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * It decides the *request* (how much room the answer needs, and how to ask for
 * the shape) and the *reading* (is what came back an analysis). It does not
 * decide the model, the temperature or the reasoning effort: those are
 * `agent_model_assignments` rows an operator owns from the Model Hub, and a code
 * default that overrode one would take that lever away silently.
 *
 * It never repairs and never invents. Recovery is `salvage.pure.ts`, which is
 * the render path's reader too, so a row this module writes and a row that route
 * reads can never disagree about what the model said.

 * visible JSON out of a 12,000 budget, leaving 6,300–7,500 to reasoning. So the
 * content grows at about 1,100 tokens a property over a 2,500-token frame, and
 * the reasoning allowance has to sit on top of it rather than inside it.
 *
 * The allowance is generous because the two errors are not symmetric: asking for
 * headroom the model does not use costs nothing (billing is on tokens generated,
 * and latency follows the answer's length, not the ceiling), while asking for
 * too little costs the whole document and the 75 seconds spent producing it.
