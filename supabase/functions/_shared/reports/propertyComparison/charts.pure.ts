/**
 * The two pictures this document has a use for.
 *
 * A comparison is a ranking, not a composition and not a projection, so most of
 * the shared chart vocabulary has nothing to say about it. Two questions survive
 * the test of "answers something the table answers slowly":
 *
 *   How far apart are they?   The table gives the order. What decides whether the
 *                             ranking *means* anything is the gap — whether the
 *                             top two are a real choice or a coin toss — and
 *                             three numbers in a column answer that slowly.
 *   A sweep, or a split?      Ten superlatives are scattered across three
 *                             sections. Whether one property took them all or
 *                             they split four ways is visible nowhere.
 *
 * ## What was rejected, which is the more useful half
 *
 * A **risk-against-rank quadrant** — *is the best one also the riskiest?* — is
 * the most decision-relevant question the format leaves unanswered, and it is
 * still not drawn here. `riskLevel` is free text with ten distinct values in the
 * record (`Low-Moderate`, `Moderate`, `Moderate-Low`, `Moderate-High`, `Moderate
 * to High`, `High`, `High (Undetermined)`, `Very High`, `Critical`, `Extreme`),
 * three of them spellings of one idea and one meaning "unknown, assume the worst"
 * rather than a level at all. Putting that on a numeric axis manufactures
 * precision the source does not have. The question is answered instead by a
 * *column*: the risk band sits beside the rank in the verdict table, which states
 * the relationship directly and invents nothing.
 *
 * A **score wheel over the properties** — a radar's spokes must be dimensions of
 * one subject; one spoke per property makes the enclosed area an artefact of the
 * order the properties were selected in.
 *
 * A **score wheel over the criteria** (yield, growth, location, demand, risk) is
 * the right shape and the data is not here: `property_comparisons` stores no
 * per-dimension breakdown, only `finalScore`.
 *
 * A **gauge** on the top score — already the largest thing on the page in the KPI
 * strip, and a 0–100 dial is a lie on the six comparisons scored out of ten.
 *
 * A **heatmap** of property against category — the scorecard is binary, exactly
 * one winner per category, so it would be one hot cell per column: a scatter plot
 * drawn as a grid, and unable to carry the winner's reason.
 *
 * A **waterfall** — nothing in a comparison accumulates. A **bullet** — needs a
 * target, and no property here is measured against a threshold, only against the
 * others.
 *
 * Neither chart is load-bearing: each returns `''` when its data is absent or
 * degenerate, and the section prints its table either way.
