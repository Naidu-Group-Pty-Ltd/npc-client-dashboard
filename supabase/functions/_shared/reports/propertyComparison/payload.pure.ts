/**
 * What a Property Comparison Analysis says, as a shape.
 *
 * ## Where the trust boundary is, and why it is further out than the other three
 *
 * Cash Flow does not trust the browser because the browser owns the arithmetic.
 * Borrowing Capacity does not let the browser decide the contents at all. The
 * Portfolio Review trusts its figures and distrusts its prose. Here **there are
 * no deterministic figures at all** — every field this document prints was
 * written by a model in one response and stored, so the whole payload is
 * optional structure.
 *
 * That has one consequence worth stating up front: this contract has almost no
 * `Measure`s. A comparison does not carry money or yields; it carries a ranking,
 * ten superlatives naming a winner apiece, and prose. The one number it does
 * carry — `finalScore` — arrives on **two different scales**, which is why it is
 * modelled as a value *and* its denominator rather than as a bare figure.
 *
 * ## Two storage shapes, one payload
 *
 * `property_comparisons` holds the same document in two states, both stamped
 * `structure_version = 1`:
 *
 *  - **`columns`** — the seven jsonb columns are populated. 23 of 50 rows.
 *  - **`salvaged`** — every jsonb column is NULL and the model's raw, *truncated*
 *    response sits in `executive_summary`. 27 of 50 rows.
 *
 * A salvaged row is not a degraded row. Six of its ten sections are recorded in
 * full; they are simply followed by a cut. `salvage.pure.ts` reads them back, and
 * this contract carries `provenance` so the document can say what happened —
 * because on a salvaged record `recommendations` is absent **every time**, and a
 * ranked comparison that silently omits "which should I buy" reads as a finished
 * document that forgot to answer its own question.
 *
 * ## `propertyNumber` is a pointer, and it is often null
 *
 * The superlatives do not embed a property; they name one by 1-based index into
 * `properties`. Of 92 winner pointers in the record, 74 name a property, 6 are
 * `0` and 12 are `null` — both meaning *nobody wins this axis*. So every pointer
 * is modelled as `PropertyRef | null` and resolved once, in the normaliser, so no
 * renderer ever computes `properties[n - 1]` and reads index `-1`.
