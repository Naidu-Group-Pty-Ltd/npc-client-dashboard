/**
 * What the document contains, and in what order.
 *
 * ## The verdict goes first
 *
 * The producer writes its recommendation tenth, and the legacy markdown prints it
 * near the end. This document opens with it. Someone who chose to compare
 * properties does not need walking to the answer — the same posture as the
 * Portfolio's "Where the portfolio stands" — and on a truncated record it means
 * the reader learns in the first ten seconds that the record is incomplete rather
 * than after eight sections.
 *
 * ## Placeholders, on the salvaged path only
 *
 * The other three formats drop a section whose block is missing, and are right
 * to: absence there is incidental and unknowable to the reader. Here, on a
 * salvaged record, absence is systematic — `recommendations` survives on two of
 * twenty-seven rows — and a ranked comparison that silently omits *which one
 * should I buy* reads as a finished document that forgot to answer its own
 * question. So a section named in `provenance.missing` is still built, still
 * numbered and still listed, with a body that says what is not there.
 *
 * On the `columns` path a null column drops its section exactly as before.
