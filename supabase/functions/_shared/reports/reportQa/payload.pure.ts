/**
 * What a Report Q&A document says, as a shape.
 *
 * ## Three subjects, one format
 *
 * The Q&A feature has four PDF implementations across three libraries and they
 * do not produce the same document. Two of them are jsPDF and are reachable;
 * one is jsPDF and is dead code; one is pdf-lib and lives in the edge function.
 * Between them they answer three genuinely different questions:
 *
 *  - **`structured`** — the model's own write-up of the whole conversation,
 *    persisted at `report_qa_conversations.structured_report`. What a client is
 *    meant to receive. Avg 8,193 characters, max 18,912, bounded by the
 *    producer's `max_completion_tokens: 8192`.
 *  - **`answer`** — one assistant message, edited or not. What a broker asks for
 *    when a single reply is the useful thing. Max 33,377 characters.
 *  - **`transcript`** — what was actually asked and actually said. No model
 *    involved, always available, and the only one that is unbounded: the largest
 *    conversation in the record is 354,406 characters across 70 messages.
 *
 * They are one format because they are one document with three spines, not
 * three documents. Collapsing them is the point — four implementations is how
 * the same table-rendering defect got fixed in one copy and not the other two.
 *
 * ## The payload is prose, and that is the whole difficulty
 *
 * Every format migrated before this one had a typed payload: `Measure` fields,
 * arithmetic, columns somebody declared. This one has a `text` column holding
 * Markdown a model wrote. So the payload here is *structure around prose* — who
 * asked, when, which model answered, what it cited — and the prose itself goes
 * through `markdown.pure.ts` at render time rather than being parsed into
 * fields. Parsing figures out of the prose to restate them elsewhere would be a
 * second answer to a question the prose already answers, which is the failure
 * this programme exists to remove.
 *
 * ## Nothing is derived that the record holds
 *
 * `report_qa_conversations.report_names` and `report_contents` are the grounding
 * documents; `title` is what the conversation is called. None of them is
 * recomputed here. What *is* derived is the turn pairing — a question and the
 * answer that followed it — because the table stores messages in a flat list and
 * pairing them is a reading, not a fact.

 * exporter redeclares a thin `Message` of `role | content | timestamp`
 * (`ConversationExport.tsx:14`), so nothing downstream ever sees them. A Q&A PDF
 * currently carries no source attribution at all. Zero messages in the record
 * have one, so this closes a latent defect rather than a live one — which is

/**
 * The transcript's budget, in estimated printed lines across all turns.
 *
 * ## Why lines and not characters
 *
 * Characters were the obvious cap and they are the wrong one. What the page band
 * bounds is *pages*, and a transcript's pages come from two things: the prose,
 * and the furniture each exchange carries — a question callout, a provenance
 * line, a chapter header and the gaps around them. Measured against the record,
 * the furniture dominates. A 42,000-character conversation of 70 short exchanges
 * runs to about 45 pages; a 42,000-character conversation of 5 long ones runs to
 * about 15. A character cap admits the first and a turn cap refuses the second,
 * so neither alone is a budget.
 *
 * `TURN_FURNITURE_LINES + chars / CHARS_PER_LINE` per turn is within a few per
 * cent of what `markdown.pure.ts` goes on to count for real, and it needs no
 * parse — which is what lets the normaliser apply it before 350 KB of Markdown
 * is handed to a scanner.
 *
 * ## Where the number comes from
 *
 * 25 pages of body at `LINES_PER_PAGE`, which leaves the cover, contents,
 * sources and closing pages inside the archetype's 30-page ceiling. Against the
 * record that keeps **96% of conversations whole**: the p90 conversation
 * estimates at 414 lines and the p96 at 910. The four above it run to 5,751,
 * which is over a hundred and fifty printed pages.
 *
 * What is cut is said on the page, and the `.md` and `.txt` exports stay
 * uncapped and are what the notice points at.
