/**
 * Text handling shared by every report format.

/**
 * Turn a URL in model prose back into plain text.
 *
 * Not hygiene — a correctness fix for a failure that takes the whole document
 * down. `assertSafeRenderResources` decodes HTML entities *first*
 * (`renderResourcePolicy.pure.ts:68`) and then throws on any `//host`,
 * `http(s)://`, `file:`, `ftp:` or `gopher:` token **anywhere in the HTML**,
 * including inside escaped body text:
 *
 *     Remote render resources must be normalized into project storage
 *
 * So a model that writes "per corelogic.com.au/median-values" with a scheme on
 * the front fails the render with an error naming no field and no line. Escaping
 * does not help: the policy undoes it before it looks.
 *
 * The scheme and its slashes are removed and the rest of the token kept, so the
 * sentence still reads and still says where the claim came from — `URL_TOKEN`
 * does not match a bare host. Dropping the whole token would silently delete a
 * citation from a client's document, which is a worse answer than a link that
 * is not clickable in a PDF anyway.
 *
 * ## Run this *after* any pass that removes characters
 *
 * Stripping zero-width characters is what *creates* a scheme-relative URL. A
 * slash, a U+200B, a slash is inert until the zero-width space goes, and then it
 * is a live `//` the policy throws on. Any sanitiser that deletes codepoints —
 * the Q&A export's glyph pass is the one that does — must run before this,
 * never after.
