 * `party_screening_subjects` was only ever written when an operator resolved
 * a RELATED-PARTY reconciliation item. The case subject — the customer the
 * case is about — was never enrolled by anything, despite
 * `partyScreening.pure.ts` stating that "the case subject is always
 * assessed". A straightforward individual purchase declares no related
 * parties, so it produced no reconciliation items, no subjects, and a Stage 5
 * with nothing to screen and nothing to press. Measured on this deployment:
 * 0 subjects across every case, including one with three submissions.
 *
 * It runs on READ as well as on sync, and returns only what is missing, so
 * every existing case self-heals the first time somebody opens it. It is
 * idempotent by identity (party type + party id + name), never by a flag.
 *
 * It enrols people. It screens nobody and decides no outcome.

/**
 * Run a screening request NOW, and guarantee it lands somewhere.
 *
 * ── The silence this closes ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Inline execution already existed, and its failure went into a field on the
 * response that no surface reads. Measured in production on 2026-08-18: a
 * subject queued at 08:05:58 was still `queued` twenty-seven minutes later
 * with `error_category` null, no screening check, and no case event — while
 * the stage told the operator "nothing has picked it up".
 *
 * Something HAD picked it up. It failed, and the failure was discarded.
 *
 * Meanwhile the durable path behind it was dead too: every
 * `aml.screening.requested` row in that deployment carries `attempts = 0`,
 * because the worker's cron invocation is rejected with
 * `invalid_internal_signature` (2,839 denials recorded in `security_events`).
 * So neither path converged and neither said so.
 *
 * ── The rule ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An operator action must never come to rest on `queued`. After the attempt
 * this RE-READS the subject, and if it is still unclaimed with no check and
 * no recorded category, it records one. A person then sees a reason instead
 * of a spinner, and the explicit Retry has something concrete to retry.
 *
 * It produces no screening OUTCOME. `state: 'error'` leaves the scope
 * outstanding and the stage blocked; nothing here can read as clear.

 * anything else: nothing could gate on it, and "which cases were exempted
 * from sanctions screening, on what basis, under which policy version" —
 * the question an audit actually asks — had no answer at all.

 * as it was made.
 *
 * ── The mapping onto subjects ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `PARTY_SCREENING_SCOPE` in the consumer is `['sanctions']`: a party
 * screening run IS a sanctions run. So `party_screening_subjects.required`
 * means "this party must be sanctions-screened", and it follows the
 * sanctions scope exactly. PEP is unaffected — it is established through
 * `pep_determinations`, not by this provider — which is what lets sanctions
 * be not_required while PEP stays mandatory.
 *
 * ── The one thing an exemption does NOT do ────────────────────────────
 * A subject that already holds a FINDING keeps `required = true`, whatever
 * the perimeter says. Once a candidate or confirmed match exists you cannot
 * un-know it, and the obligation to deal with a positive result comes from
 * the sanction itself rather than from the screening obligation that
 * surfaced it. Standing that down would be the one genuinely dangerous
 * reading of "not required".
 *
 * Evidence is never destroyed either: a completed check keeps its result and
 * its `screening_check_id`; only the obligation flag moves.

       * for ever and the only way out was a database edit.
       *
       * This is bounded and evidence-driven. It refuses unless the subject is
       * genuinely stuck — queued, with no screening check, and with a queue
       * entry older than the stall window — so it can never cancel work that
       * is actually in flight. It retires the dead outbox rows rather than
       * leaving them to be claimed later and race the retry, and it produces
       * no screening outcome.

       *
       * An operator who has reached the end of the available checking and is
       * NOT satisfied has established nothing. Until now the dialog offered
       * only "not a PEP" or "PEP", so the way out of that position was to
       * assert one of them: an unfounded conclusion, written down, indexed,
       * and indistinguishable afterwards from a real one. AUSTRAC expressly
       * contemplates the opposite — that further information is collected
       * when the entity is not yet satisfied.
       *
       * So this writes NO determination. It records what was checked, why it
       * did not settle the question and what is needed, on the case audit
       * trail. The PEP scope stays outstanding, the step stays blocking, and
       * the stage stays open — which is the honest state.

       *
       * The index is partial by construction — no public source lists every

       * An index that has never loaded, or whose last load FAILED, reads as
