/**
 * AML/CTF Client Portal (Phase 3)
 *
 * Client-facing onboarding surface. Authenticates via `x-portal-session-token`
 * against `client_portal_sessions` and only ever operates on AML cases whose
 * `client_id` matches the signed-in portal user.
 *
 * Ops:
 *   - overview                     { case_id? }         → landing payload
 *   - get_questionnaire            { case_id, section } → current draft
 *   - save_questionnaire           { case_id, section, payload, submit? }
 *   - get_consents                 { case_id }          → current AUSTRAC-referenced catalogue + acceptance state
 *   - record_consent               { case_id, kind, version?, payload? }
 *   - verification_status          { case_id }          → per-party state + which flow to render
 *   - start_hosted_verification    { case_id, party_id?, party_label? }
 *                                                      → provider-hosted session URL (never stored)
 *   - submit_verification          { case_id, ... }     → self-hosted capture path only
 *   - list_requirements            { case_id }
 *   - request_upload_url           { case_id, requirement_id?, filename, mime_type, size_bytes }
 *   - confirm_upload               { case_id, requirement_id?, storage_path, filename, display_name?, mime_type, size_bytes, checksum? }
 *   - list_documents               { case_id }
 *   - get_document_url             { case_id, document_id }
 *                                                      → 120s signed read URL (never stored)
 *   - list_client_requests         { case_id }
 *   - respond_client_request       { request_id, response_payload }
 *   - submit_for_review            { case_id }         → creates submission_versions row
 *
 * Client statuses returned are sanitised — no risk score, no screening results,
 * no MLRO commentary. Only completion + acceptance state.

 * `image/*` and it is a document with a script element in it, so it is an
 * image everywhere except here. `text/html` is absent for the same reason.
 *

       * their face exists anywhere: the portal session, the case, the party,
       * the consent catalogue, the separate biometric consent, provider
       * readiness, the attempt ceiling and one-in-flight.
       *
       * That ordering is the lesson this operation exists to hold. The old flow
       * asked for one upload grant, wrote the document, and only then hit the
       * gate on the second grant — so a case with no live provider uploaded a
       * customer's identity document and abandoned the submission. Production
       * accumulated nine orphaned documents and not one verification row.
       *
       * ## Preparing consumes NOTHING
       *
       * The row it creates is a `draft`: `attempt_consumed` is false, the
       * outbox trigger declines to emit for it, and
       * `aml.verification_attempts_used()` — which counts consumed attempts —
       * cannot see it. A customer may prepare, open the camera, change their
       * mind, close the tab and come back, as many times as they like, at no
       * cost to their allowance. `uq_aml_verification_draft_capture` makes the
       * operation idempotent: a second tab resumes the same attempt and the
       * same three paths rather than minting a second set.
       *
       * ## What comes back
       *
       * An attempt id, which sides to photograph, and three short-lived signed
       * upload permissions for objects the SERVER named. No provider name, no
       * endpoint, no workflow, no threshold, no key — nothing the browser could
       * use to reach a verification vendor, because it never does.

       * because `request_upload_url` does not constrain the stored content
       * type and the storage origin is the same host as this API, so an HTML
       * upload served inline would execute there. That reasoning is sound and
       * the conclusion was too broad: it also meant a customer pressing "View"
       * on their own PDF was handed a download rather than a document.
       *
       * So the type is checked instead of assumed. A content type in
       * `INLINE_VIEWABLE_MIME_TYPES` is served inline and everything else
       * keeps the attachment disposition exactly as before — including, on
       * purpose, `image/svg+xml`, which the upload control's `image/*` admits
       * and which is a scriptable document wearing an image's name.
       *
       * The type consulted is the one STORAGE WILL SERVE, read back from the
       * object, and not the row's `mime_type`. They come from the same client
       * but by different routes — the content type was set on the PUT, the
       * column was sent afterwards by `confirm_upload` — so they can disagree,
       * and the served value is the only one that decides how a browser treats
       * the response. An unreadable or unknown type is not in the set, so the
       * failure direction is a download.
       *
       * 120 seconds: long enough for the browser to follow it, short enough
       * that a URL captured from history or a proxy log is already dead.
