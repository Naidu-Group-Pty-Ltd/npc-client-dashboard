-- Migration: Fix Email and Communication Data RLS Policies
-- Purpose: Remove overly permissive policies on email and communication tables
-- Security: All access must go through authenticated edge functions
-- Date: 2025-01-24

BEGIN;

-- ============================================
-- STEP 1: Drop existing permissive policies
-- ============================================

-- email_copilot_emails: Remove 4 overly permissive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public delete access to emails" ON email_copilot_emails;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public insert access to emails" ON email_copilot_emails;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to emails" ON email_copilot_emails;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public update access to emails" ON email_copilot_emails;

-- email_copilot_sent_replies: Remove 2 overly permissive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow insert access to sent replies" ON email_copilot_sent_replies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow read access to sent replies" ON email_copilot_sent_replies;

-- vapi_call_logs: Remove misnamed policies (they say "Service role" but apply to "public")
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can insert call logs" ON vapi_call_logs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can update call logs" ON vapi_call_logs;

-- ============================================
-- STEP 2: Create secure policies for email_copilot_emails
-- ============================================
-- Users can only access emails for their clients (via client_id -> clients.created_by)
-- Or emails they created themselves (via created_by)

-- SELECT: Users can view emails for their clients or emails they created

    (created_by = auth.uid())

-- DELETE: Users can delete emails for their clients or emails they created

    OR
    -- Email is not linked to any client (general emails accessible to all authenticated users)

-- ============================================
-- STEP 3: Create secure policies for email_copilot_sent_replies
-- ============================================
-- Users can only access replies for emails they can access

-- SELECT: Users can view replies for emails they can access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view replies for their emails" ON email_copilot_sent_replies;

    )
    OR

        ))
        OR

-- UPDATE: Users can update replies for emails they can access

CREATE POLICY "Users can update replies for their emails"

    )
    OR

-- DELETE: Users can delete replies for emails they can access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete replies for their emails" ON email_copilot_sent_replies;
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete replies for their emails"

      AND (
        -- Email is linked to a client owned by the user
        (e.client_id IS NOT NULL AND EXISTS (
          SELECT 1 FROM clients c
          WHERE c.id = e.client_id

        OR

      )
    )
    OR
    -- Reply was created by the user
    (created_by = auth.uid()::text)
  );

-- ============================================
-- STEP 4: Secure vapi_call_logs
-- ============================================
-- Since vapi_call_logs doesn't have a direct user/client relationship,
-- we'll restrict access to authenticated users only
-- Note: Service role policies remain for edge functions

-- SELECT: Authenticated users can view call logs
-- (In practice, edge functions will filter by client_id if needed)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view call logs" ON vapi_call_logs;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view call logs"
  ON vapi_call_logs FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- INSERT: Only service role can insert (via edge functions)
-- No policy needed - service role has full access

-- UPDATE: Only service role can update (via edge functions)
-- No policy needed - service role has full access

-- DELETE: Only service role can delete (via edge functions)
-- No policy needed - service role has full access

-- ============================================
-- Security Model Explanation
-- ============================================
-- After removing overly permissive policies:
-- - email_copilot_emails: Users can only access emails for their clients
-- - email_copilot_sent_replies: Users can only access replies for emails they can access
-- - vapi_call_logs: Authenticated users can view, but service role handles writes
--
-- This ensures:
-- 1. Email data is protected from unauthorized access
-- 2. Users cannot access emails for other users' clients
-- 3. All write operations go through authenticated edge functions
-- 4. Compliance with data protection regulations
