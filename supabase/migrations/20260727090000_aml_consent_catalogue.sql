-- AML/CTF client-portal consent catalogue (AUSTRAC-referenced).

-- Consent was previously a hard-coded three-checkbox list in the client
-- portal bundle, gated only by localStorage. That is not defensible as
-- evidence: the wording could change with a deploy, nothing recorded WHAT
-- the client saw, and the "wall" was bypassable client-side.
--
-- This migration introduces a versioned, server-owned catalogue. Each
-- acceptance in aml.consents can now be tied to the exact document text
-- and statutory basis presented at the time, which is what an AUSTRAC
-- reviewer or an independent evaluation (AML/CTF Act s 84) will ask for.
