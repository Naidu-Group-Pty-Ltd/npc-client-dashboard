-- Brand snapshots for generated reports.
--
-- A report is a dated artefact. A client asking to re-issue the assessment they
-- were given eighteen months ago must receive the same document — not one
-- wearing whatever the tenant's branding happens to be today, and not one
-- missing its logo because the bucket has since been rotated. Pinning the brand
-- values at generation time is the only way that holds.
--
-- The precedent is `client_fact_find_brand_snapshots` (migration 20260801120000)
-- with `client_fact_find_outputs.branding_snapshot_id ON DELETE RESTRICT`. This
-- generalises it with one change: snapshots are deduplicated by content
-- fingerprint rather than written one-per-artefact. A tenant's brand changes a
-- handful of times a year and renders thousands of reports; a row per render is
-- thousands of identical rows.
--
-- Shape and fingerprint are produced by
-- `supabase/functions/_shared/reportDesign/snapshot.pure.ts`. The payload is
-- jsonb rather than columns because it carries base64 logo data URIs and a
-- versioned nested shape — `snapshot_version` is what a reader checks before
-- trusting the mapping, and it is a real column so a query can find stale rows.
