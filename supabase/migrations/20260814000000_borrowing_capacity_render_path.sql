-- The Borrowing Capacity Snapshot's render path.
--
-- Two things, both of which the format needs before a document can be generated
-- server-side. See docs/reports/BORROWING_CAPACITY.md.
--
-- ── 1. Keep the audit trail and the explanation (F12) ───────────────────────
--
-- `calculate-borrowing-capacity` builds both on every assessment and returns
-- them in its response — and its INSERT does not write them, because there is
-- nowhere to write them. Every generator reads them off the stored row, in
-- camelCase, from an all-snake_case table, so they are always undefined. Two
-- pages of the report — the two that would actually explain a lending decision
-- to the client — have never appeared in a document anyone received.
--
-- The alternative was to recompute them at render time. That is worse: a
-- recomputation runs against today's policy and today's HEM benchmark, so the
-- audit trail could disagree with the headline figures printed beside it on the
-- same page. A report must explain the numbers it is showing, not different
-- ones.
--
-- jsonb rather than columns: both are versioned nested shapes owned by the
-- engine (`AuditTrailData`, `ExplanationReport`), and flattening them here would
-- mean a migration every time the engine grows an entry type.

  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS audit_trail jsonb,

COMMENT ON COLUMN public.borrowing_capacity_assessments.audit_trail IS
  'AuditTrailData from calculate-borrowing-capacity: every value the lender adjusted, what it started as, and the rule that moved it. Read by the report renderer; see supabase/functions/_shared/reports/borrowingCapacity/audit.pure.ts for the unit and polarity of each entry.';

  'ExplanationReport from calculate-borrowing-capacity: the assessment step by step, in plain terms.';

-- ── 2. A record of what was sent, and under whose brand ─────────────────────
--
-- The artefact side of `report_brand_snapshots` (migration 20260813000000) for
-- this format. `investment_reports.brand_snapshot_id` covers the investment
-- report; a Borrowing Capacity Snapshot has no report row of its own, so this
-- is it.
--
-- It is a job row as well as a record: a render that fails leaves a row saying
-- why, which is the difference between "the client says the PDF never arrived"
-- and an answer.
