-- The 10 Year Cash Flow Analysis's render path.
--
-- One table: a record of what was sent, and under whose brand.
--
-- The projection itself is deliberately **not** stored here. It is not the
-- server's to own — `CashFlowAnalysisModal` computes it live from overrides the
-- adviser may not have saved, and `cash_flow_analyses.analysis_data` already
-- holds the saved form. Duplicating it would create a second answer to "what
-- did this report say", which is the failure mode this programme is removing,
-- not adding.
--
-- What is worth keeping is the artefact: which file was produced, from which
-- report, by whom, under which pinned brand, and — when it failed — why. That
-- last column is the difference between "the client says the PDF never arrived"
-- and an answer.
