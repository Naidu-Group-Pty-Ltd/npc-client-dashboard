-- The Portfolio Performance Review's render path.
--
-- One table: a record of what was produced, from which report, and under whose
-- brand.
--
-- The document's contents are deliberately **not** stored here. Unlike the Cash
-- Flow ledger — whose subject is computed live in the browser — everything this
-- format says already lives in `portfolio_analysis_reports.report_data` and, when
-- there is one, a `portfolio_reviews` row. Both are pointed at below. Copying
-- their contents into a third place would create a second answer to "what did
-- this review say", which is the failure mode this programme is removing.
--
-- What is worth keeping is the artefact, and the two rows it was made from: a
-- reader of this table can reproduce any document it names.
--
-- Note what this migration does *not* do: it does not touch
-- `portfolio_analysis_reports.pdf_file_path`. That column is what *publish to
-- client portal* reads (`manage-client-data/index.ts:540-609`, uniqueness-guarded
-- by `20260724000000_prevent_duplicate_portfolio_publications.sql`). Pointing it
-- at a document produced by a different renderer would silently change what every
-- future publication sends a client. Switching that over stays a separate,
-- deliberate decision.
