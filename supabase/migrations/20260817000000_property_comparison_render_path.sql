-- The Property Comparison Analysis's render path.
--
-- One table: a record of what was produced, from which comparison, and under
-- whose brand.
--
-- The document's contents are deliberately **not** stored here. Everything this
-- format prints is already in the `property_comparisons` row, which is pointed at
-- below. Copying it would create a second answer to "what did this comparison
-- say", which is the failure mode this programme is removing.
--
-- Three columns no prior ledger needed, and the reason they exist:
--
--   Twenty-seven of the fifty stored comparisons were saved *while the analysis
--   was still being written*. The producer asks a model for ten sections of JSON
--   under a 12,000-token ceiling; for five properties the response is cut off,
--   the parse throws, and the raw text is stored with every structured column
--   left NULL. The renderer reads those rows back and says on the page which
--   sections the record does not hold.
--
--   `source_shape`, `recovered_sections` and `missing_sections` are how that
--   becomes answerable after the fact: "how many documents did we send from a
--   truncated record, and what was missing from them" should be one query rather
--   than a re-render of everything.
--
-- `score_scale` is here for a related reason: `rankings[].finalScore` is recorded
-- out of 100 on most rows and out of 10 on six, the newest included, and the
-- renderer infers which. Recording what it inferred means the inference can be
-- audited instead of trusted.
--
-- Note what this migration does *not* do: it adds nothing to
-- `property_comparisons`. No `pdf_file_path`, no backfill of the recovered JSON
-- into the seven columns, and no `structure_version` bump. That column already
-- means two things; writing rows we did not produce would make it mean three.
