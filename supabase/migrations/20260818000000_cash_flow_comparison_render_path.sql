-- The Cash Flow Comparison Analysis's render path.
--
-- One table: a record of what was sent, of what, and under whose brand.
--
-- The projections are deliberately **not** stored here, for the reason
-- `20260815000000_cash_flow_render_path.sql` gives for the single-property
-- format: they are computed live in `CashFlowAnalysisModal` from overrides the
-- adviser may not have saved, and duplicating them would create a second answer
-- to "what did this report say".
--
-- Nor is the model's analysis. `cash_flow_analyses` already exists for that and
-- holds zero rows — its INSERT policy requires `auth.role() = 'authenticated'`
-- while this application signs in through `custom_users`, and its SELECT policy
-- requires `created_by = auth.uid()` while the modal's insert never sets
-- `created_by`. That is a real defect and it is recorded in
-- `docs/reports/CASH_FLOW_COMPARISON.md`, but it is not this table's to fix:
-- a render ledger that started persisting analyses would be a third answer.
--
-- What is worth keeping is the artefact and the shape of what produced it.

  -- rather than storing a damaged row, so there is nothing to salvage; what does
