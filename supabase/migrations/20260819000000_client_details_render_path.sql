-- The Client Details report's render path.
--
-- One table: a record of what was sent, about whom, and under whose brand.
--
-- The client's details are deliberately **not** copied here. They are already
-- rows in nine tables and this document is a rendering of them, so a snapshot in
-- the ledger would be a second answer to "what does the record say" — the
-- failure mode this programme removes rather than adds. The same reasoning
-- `20260815000000_cash_flow_render_path.sql` gives for the projection.
--
-- What is worth keeping is the artefact and the shape of the record it came
-- from: which file was produced, for which client, by whom, under which pinned
-- brand, how much of the record had anything in it, and — when it failed — why.

  -- Measured before the work: 771 clients hold 53 properties between them, and
